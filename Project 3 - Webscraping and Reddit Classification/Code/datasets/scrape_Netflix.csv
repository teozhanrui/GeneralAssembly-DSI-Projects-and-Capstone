,netflix,"Hello everyone, 8 years ago we woke up one day and found one of our youtube videos had gone crazy on r/Videos. 8 year later thanks to lots of support form the reddit community we got our shot at our own TV show, Aunty Donna's Big Ol' House of Fun on Netflix.

We’re gonna be answering anything for the next hour or so. Answering today will be the aforementioned three performers, as well as head writer Sam Lingham, film maker Max Miller and composer Tom Armstrong.

If you don’t know who we are here's a little introductory playlist of our work so far: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEzN-y0ZMgptSc7jzquvG0XrdfOnSMAQS

,netflix,"[This](https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/m7ex7n/review_of_the_one/) is my first review of the show if you are curious. Contains minor Spoilers for Netflix's original show, ""**The One**."" You have been warned :)

So, I just finished watching the second episode, and it hasn't gotten any better. First I want to discuss Hannah. So her whole story in this episode is that she goes behind her husbands (?) back and finds what his match is, meets up with the girl, and tries to get to know her and avoid them from meeting. My issues with this is, who in their right mind would ever do this? She seemed so normal and confident in the relationship at first, but her character just flipped around!! Not only does she snoop around the girls flat; which was just such an uncomfortable scene, she is lying to her husband!! Which if he finds out, she will just ruin her own marriage! I get being insecure, but her friend told her what she was doing was insane, but she just ignored it. how ignorant can one be?

Secondly, all of the characters. They are just so rude and annoying, and not relatable at all. While yes, characters do not have to be relatable to be good, its better than being annoying insufferable jerks! And I am not in my 20's-30's like they seem to be, but what's with all the talk about sex 24/7?? It's just uncomfortable and unnecessary. They just seem to throw it in whenever they don't know what to add.  

I really want to focus on Rebecca, too. I have no idea what they are going for with her character, is it sympathy, anger, hatred? what do they want me to feel? Normally show directors have a certain emotion they want to spark when they see a character, but I just feel nothing. I have no passion or interest in anybody in this damned show! They all just do things and whine about the consequences of their stupid actions!

Another thing that bothered me a ton, is the length. I am 100% biased with shows who have 45 minute long episodes. Personally, 20-30 minutes is a much better length. of course, shows which have good and actually thought provoking content can get away with it, but with just utter trash like this, it goes on for way too long! Half of the scenes don't even need to be there to tell the story either, there's so much filler that tells us nothing. 

My family i am watching it with says ""its so good!"" ""It's like Black Mirror"" which makes me want to puke! No offense to them, they can enjoy what they want, But never compare this to the actually acceptable good show Black Mirror. And I tell them most of my criticism, but they just shove it off with 'well I don't think that.' which can be frustrating. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt, I definitely watch way too many Film analysis'/reviews on YouTube, so my sense of if a film is good or not (in my opinion) is probably a bit better than others.

So, in summary. Show is not getting better at all. The characters suck, I feel no emotion while watching it, and the runtime is awful. Feel free to share thoughts!

Normally show directors have a certain emotion they want to spark when they see a character, but I just feel nothing. I have no passion or interest in anybody in this damned show! They all just do things and whine about the consequences of their stupid actions!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing that bothered me a ton, is the length. I am 100% biased with shows who have 45 minute long episodes. Personally, 20-30 minutes is a much better length. of course, shows which have good and actually thought provoking content can get away with it, but with just utter trash like this, it goes on for way too long! Half of the scenes don&amp;#39;t even need to be there to tell the story either, there&amp;#39;s so much filler that tells us nothing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My family i am watching it with says &amp;quot;its so good!&amp;quot; &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s like Black Mirror&amp;quot; which makes me want to puke! No offense to them, they can enjoy what they want, But never compare this to the actually acceptable good show Black Mirror. And I tell them most of my criticism, but they just shove it off with &amp;#39;well I don&amp;#39;t think that.&amp;#39; which can be frustrating. I&amp;#39;ll give them the benefit of the doubt, I definitely watch way too many Film analysis&amp;#39;/reviews on YouTube, so my sense of if a film is good or not (in my opinion) is probably a bit better than others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, in summary. Show is not getting better at all. The characters suck, I feel no emotion while watching it, and the runtime is awful. Feel free to share thoughts! And tell me if i should continue these reviews!&lt;/p&gt;

,netflix,"my mother has a premium netflix account, she lives in europe with my sister. I live in UK. 

she shares her account with me whenever i want to use the service. What i'm confused about is the 'safest' way to do this - in netflix T&amp;C's it doesn't define the household as such - but i think its safe to assume that by household, they mean a household in 1 area, not spread across 2 different countries! 

so i get it, strictly speaking it's not allowed. But my question is - as there are 3 members in our household, across 2 countries, can me, mum and sister have a profile? Or would it raise alarm bells if they can see 1 of the profiles is in a different country to the other 2? 

Is it safer if we ensure that whenever i'm using the account in the UK, neither my mum or sister is using it in their country?

,netflix,"Hi,

I have a question regarding my RTV setup, it's highly connected to netlfix so I decided to post it here hoping for an answer.

So far I've been using a PS4 as way of transmitting my Netflix/Spotify signal onto an amplifier which then sent the signal to the TV. Basically my medias are connected to amplifier via HDMI and then signal is sent onto the 5.0 surround system while image is sent to the TV.

Well, when PS5 was announced I sold my og PS4 hoping to sell it before it highly drops in value. Annnnd as of now I have no source for the netflix to play of. I've been using my laptop to do that, it works but carrying it around with a charger is a pain in the ass.

I've been thinking maybe about buying a smart TV since my TV, although it works is an old 1080 32"". And I could gift it to my grandmother who is using an even older TV after getting a new one. Well but what about the signal then? With my current amplifier setup I can make it so that sound goes from TV to amplifier. But what about me wanting to play something in case I do buy a PS5 soon (once it's available). Shouldn't I opt out for a cheaper non smart TV?

B: The Beginning is a thriller with plenty of twists and turns in its story to keep you interested. It’s not really a traditional mystery because (like Death Note) the titular ‘Killer B’ that the title alludes to is revealed in the first episode and is one of our two protagonists.

One being the enigmatic Koku with his black wings and nack for murdering criminals, he is the classic lead character a teenager that struggles to maintain relevance until his backstory is fleshed out during the second half of the season. ´ He’s just an angsty teenager with black-wings and an arm that turns into a sword… that mai have a interesting backstory that might be unknown .

It's a fantastic, surprising mature young adult book series set in the 90's, and it's only ever had one adaption (a live action one that quit production part-way through due to mediocre reviews and the cost of live animal training.

,netflix,"Just finished Open House on Netflix and I  felt I needed to ask this to other die hard horror fans cause it's been on my mind for some time.  What is happening recently to the horror genre? This isn't specific to Netflix either which still has plenty of content I like (Particularly Haunting of Hill House, Apostle, The Ritual, etc), it's various streamers too like Shudder which  is doing this trend and elsewhere, but I just saw this particular movie recently and wanted to  get this out there (even though there are still plenty of horror which doesn't follow this trend, I just wanted to see  if anyone has noticed).

A  lot of  times I finish a movie made in the past 5 years and at the end  it feels  like nothing really happened or we're just seeing the very  beginning, and it seems more prominent than ever with more ""horror""  movies. Random examples besides Open House, I recently also saw A  Nightmares Wakes, A  Curse For Wellness, and They Look Like People.  Obviously lots of things *happen*, but a lot of it goes by quickly and it all feels inconsequential and  random in the end and maintains a steady headache-inducing mundane tone  without any real payoff. It's kind of more of a lite drama with a   ghost/shadowy figure thrown in or something.

I  don't  think it has to do with being a slow-burner genre, I can love those, The Shining is slow burner that maintains a real sense of atmosphere and dread that entices you to keep  watching until hell breaks loose or the twist is unveiled. Rosemary's Baby is one of my favorite horror films ever.

In the sort of movies I mentioned earlier something very fucked up and  interesting can happen for a change, and then the scene just switches. Normally something so fucked up would mean the movie is escalating, at least psychologically, and previous ""mundane"" events are making sense,  right? Nope, there's still  another hour of exposition scenes and strange pseudo-ominous character drama (including introspective as well as between characters). I  enjoy how recent horror has moved from cheap  jump scares loud sound effects and more into atmosphere, but this is  something I don't think  anybody really asked for.

These types of ""horror movies"" ""thrillers"" I have seen in recent years will  literally focus on the process of a character unwrapping a TV dinner and  putting it into the microwave for 10 minutes, or chopping up fruit to  put into a blender while the character looks very concerned.

,netflix,"It starts off like an alright thriller, I thoroughly enjoyed Simona Brown’s (Louise) acting. The complicated relationships were intriguing. But as the plot went on it got shittier.

This woman is given a 30 page journal about some seriously wild things, and it takes her DAYS (weeks?) to read it. That’s so unrealistic, given how intrigued she is.

Both the husband and the wife knew where Louise lived and never crossed paths somehow while visiting her? Mind you, they show up unannounced all the time. (Maybe the wife had an advantage over the husband on this, but still.)

I find it so hard to believe that a psychiatrist (in this rehab-y situation) would not wait to check if their patient (Adele) have swallowed their medication, knowing how defiant they were to the whole situation.

Also in the end, why not leave Adam with his father? Yes, the “boat” dialogue was like a “wink wink” to the audience, but other than that there isn’t a logical reason why Rob would want to have him around— on their honeymoon LOL!

I felt like the twists were pretty clear from early on. The camera tricks of showing an incident from above often means someone else is watching. Murder as the reason why this couple stays together was pretty clear too— before Rob’s introduction, I thought it would be the parents. (Also, does that have an explanation in the book? I just can’t believe they didn’t resolve that in the series.) And just.. astral projection. My god. What a lazy explanation for “knowing everything”.

,netflix,"It was a fun movie. I loved it so much. Especially the cheesy parts. 

But I am distressed by the obvious lack of Israel Kamakawiwo’ole. Considering the message of the movie and considering his talent and his life and the lore that surrounds the people born, that are like him. 

The movie was otherwise perfect. The sound track was absolute shit. All regurgitated Hollywood bullishit, pop style. There were like two tracks total that actually utilized Hawaiian style music and not one of them were actually locally sourced. 

But images of Keanu were everywhere and recognized. 

I’m not Hawaiian. But I’m also not ignorant to tradition and culture. Finding Ohana could have been a cultural blockbuster. Instead we got generic pop music and forced Goonies style antics. 

The only thing that saves this movie? The actors and actresses and the few and far between actual cultural references. The best scenes are the scenes depicting legit Hawaiian belief and the struggles they faced as a result of colonization. 

Don’t get me wrong. It’s an excellent movie and it’s great for family movie night. It’s got everything. 

I just wish it wasn’t White washed to appease the general public. 

The woman that physically raised me? Hapu. She identified as female. Came to the mainland states in the 60s because she thought it would be better here. Smartest most talented human I’ve ever known. And the US ruined her and she got stuck here and she was never able to go back home.

She died here near to forgotten. Because Ohana (home) and what comes with that doesn’t exist here. It should, because we are all neighbors, but people.

I’d give anything to have that kind of connection with other people. I had it with her. I try to connect with others the same way. But people are people and we are selfish creatures. 

Heart breaking.

Anyway. I highly recommend the film. It’s a great adventure and the Actors and actresses did a phenomenal job. I just wish more Hawaiian musicians would have been highlighted in the film and I wish there was no need to have this kind of conversation.

This surprised me as I had never set up a netflix account (initially I though it was spam).

Only thing I can think is someone with an email similar to mine mistyped theirs's when signing up for netflix. Has anyone had anything similar happen? For safeties sake I just changed my email password.

&lt;p&gt;This surprised me as I had never set up a netflix account (initially I though it was spam). On a hunch, I requested a password reset (going to the netflix website) and received the following email (also in turkish) &amp;quot; &lt;em&gt;Let&amp;#39;s reset your password now; then you can continue watching. RESET PASSWORD If you haven&amp;#39;t requested a password reset, you can review recent account access to see any unusual activity. We are always there for you when you need help. For more information visit our Help Center or contact us. - Your friends on Netflix&lt;/em&gt; &amp;quot;. I contacted netflix on their website, asking what the issue was, I learned that there was no billing activity connected to the email, and the client service rep signed off saying &amp;quot; &lt;em&gt;Alright. You don&amp;#39;t need to worry as the details have been taking care of. You shouldn&amp;#39;t be receiving any emails from Netflix. Moving forward.&lt;/em&gt; &amp;quot; Snap shot below of the initial email, which includes a valid name and domain. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reading through reddit, someone had a very similar event about a year ago here: &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/f3cyh6/i_am_receiving_emails_in_turkish_from_netflix_is/""&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/f3cyh6/i_am_receiving_emails_in_turkish_from_netflix_is/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only thing I can think is someone with an email similar to mine mistyped theirs&amp;#39;s when signing up for netflix. Has anyone had anything similar happen? For safeties sake I just changed my email password.&lt;/p&gt;

I have a 32 inch monitor connected to my imac and my pc, I also have an Asus TUF gaming monitor connected to both. In any case, viewing on any computer monitor (including the imac's lovely built-in screen), dark scenes on netflix look like an awful low-res mess. The colour depth is not great, but the banding is just insane. I've only started thinking about it so hard because if I get into bed and keep watching on my ipad the jump in picture quality is huge, the resolution appears much crsiper, the image looks softer and nicer, and the banding situation is just totally different, there is SO much less of it, perhaps none at all. The difference is so profound that it leads me to assume I am watching a differently encoded file when viewing on my ipad. I watch loads of netflix on my monitor though as I often have it on whilst I work. I understand the ipad is displaying the video at a lower resolution but is that really the beginning and end of the explanation?

Really wish I could watch browser-netflix to a ""TV standard"", just as I can watch a movie in the living room and it look's great. I assume there is no 'fix' for this but I'm just reaching out to see if there is anything at all I can do about it.

I get the argument that movies don't have to be realistic ""cause they're just movies"", but ""I care a lot"" is worse than the Disney Starwars Movies. Here are some of what I thought were some honorable mentions:

* In court, people are just shouting and screaming as they wish. No expert here, but aren't only the lawyers allowed to speak?
* Why didn't the fashionable purple tie lawyer ask to get a second doctor to review the old lady? The judge would for sure say yes, and the second doctor would see that the old lady is pumped way too high with drugs.
* Why did the leader of the Russian mafia send only 3 people in to get his mother from the nursing home? He could easily have done 5-6
* Why did the security guard just start firing his weapon at first sight of the mobsters? He didn't even know they were mobsters? Not even Chicago Police officers take out their guns that quickly
* Why did the main character and her girlfriend go immediately when they heard that the nursing home was being attacked, why not call the police?  

   * Let's say that they both managed to kill the blonde mobster on the way out of the nursing home with a baseball bat while he had a gun because of feminism, why didn't the Russian Mob boss send out a couple of guys to rescue his mother when she's right there in his sight? Since the gangsters literally only have to kill two people without guns to complete the mission.
* When Peter Dinklage gave the okay to murder her, I'm sure the producers did this on purpose, but how are we supposed to think she survived when she got her lungs pumped with liquid and was in a devastating car crash
* Then how are we supposed to believe that the mob decided to just leave her dark-haired girlfriend alive when they know that if you leave people alive they can call the police and generate evidence to have them arrested?
* .
* .
* The last point I would like to make is that the last quote towards the end of the movie by Peter Dinklage ""Or you could become my partner"" is the part where I almost threw up. A real Russian mob boss would have given her the money and killed her on the spot

I honestly didn't mean to make this post offensive, I apologize in advance if I hurt anyone's feelings. I am glad that there is more female representation in action-thriller movies, although, there is no need to explicitly state your themes of feminism in the writing of the movie. Even though the movie is obviously created to be ""progressive,"" it seems that a lot of the women in it are type-casted, like ""the tall confident lesbian that doesn't take shit from no man"" I feel is kind of a stereotype for lesbian women. I bet the producers are thinking "" there's no way a straight woman could be so ruthless and powerful we have to make her lesbian.""

&lt;li&gt;Let&amp;#39;s say that they both managed to kill the blonde mobster on the way out of the nursing home with a baseball bat while he had a gun because of feminism, why didn&amp;#39;t the Russian Mob boss send out a couple of guys to rescue his mother when she&amp;#39;s right there in his sight? Since the gangsters literally only have to kill two people without guns to complete the mission.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Peter Dinklage gave the okay to murder her, I&amp;#39;m sure the producers did this on purpose, but how are we supposed to think she survived when she got her lungs pumped with liquid and was in a devastating car crash&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then how are we supposed to believe that the mob decided to just leave her dark-haired girlfriend alive when they know that if you leave people alive they can call the police and generate evidence to have them arrested?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last point I would like to make is that the last quote towards the end of the movie by Peter Dinklage &amp;quot;Or you could become my partner&amp;quot; is the part where I almost threw up. A real Russian mob boss would have given her the money and killed her on the spot&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I honestly didn&amp;#39;t mean to make this post offensive, I apologize in advance if I hurt anyone&amp;#39;s feelings. I am glad that there is more female representation in action-thriller movies, although, there is no need to explicitly state your themes of feminism in the writing of the movie. Even though the movie is obviously created to be &amp;quot;progressive,&amp;quot; it seems that a lot of the women in it are type-casted, like &amp;quot;the tall confident lesbian that doesn&amp;#39;t take shit from no man&amp;quot; I feel is kind of a stereotype for lesbian women. I bet the producers are thinking &amp;quot; there&amp;#39;s no way a straight woman could be so ruthless and powerful we have to make her lesbian.&amp;quot; I also am upset by this epidemic of less than mediocre movie writing and plots being covered up with exceptional production quality and videography. It goes to show the gilded nature the movie industry is turning into.&lt;/p&gt;

,netflix,"Hi, so I have been having issues loading Netflix and Fast.com through my internet, have this issue network wide. Everything else such as Prime, Youtube and Hulu play just fine. My internet speed is 100 down. 

What works right now, is that I use (redacted) to load up a video and then close the (redacted) connection, my wifi is able to buffer the video just fine after the initial connection. When I move on to the next episode, I have to reconnect to (redacted) to start the video. 

** I have tried following things: **
- Reset modem(Arris SB6190) and router(Netgear R6400)
- Switch DNS from automatic to Google and Cloudflare
- Restart both modem and router

,netflix,"Edit: see below if you get these

I have many email accounts. Some are spam account, others are for business, others are just for specific purposes. While I do have a netflix account, it's on a very specific email address and as far as I know i've never put my other email accounts into any netflix profile or anything, ESPECIALLY my work email, which is on the company domain.

So a couple weeks ago when I got an email in my company email saying ""Thanks for setting up your netflix account!"" I dismissed it as phishing. Didn't even open it. Today I got another on one of my personal email accounts. This time I looked deeper into it. It's not Phishing. It actually comes from the [netflix.com](https://netflix.com) domain, all the links in the email ACTUALLY link to [netflix.com](https://netflix.com) pages, and even the unsubscribe and ""contact us"" links go to actual [netflix.com](https://netflix.com) pages.

So I went back into the company email spam folder, checked it. It's a legit email too. Everything in the email comes from and goes to [netflix.com](https://netflix.com) pages.

Should I be contacting netflix and making sure there aren't netflix accounts being set up with my personal and work email accounts? My best bet is that some affiliate is setting up ""free 1 month trial"" accounts without authorization and getting a kickback for it.

Stranger Things (if you want to make a dark story, then dont do it with kids as the heroes. if you do that, then at least make their characters extremely strong-headed and mature. normally, movies with stereotypical ""unpopular kids"" as main characters are happy or comedy so its fine doing that but not in a show that you intend to make a dark one. also, why must you throw in romance in a show with kids as the main characters.)

Breaking Bad (the premise and everything is great. the story is great. its just way too stretched out. i havent seen it fully as it stretched the story of a dying person to 4 seasons and ended with him dying not even by cancer which was the start of the whole thing. this is better than the rest but too stretched out.)

I did actually like the movie and thought a lot of things were well done but while some aspects were impressive the same old tired stereotypes and one dimensional characters left a bad taste in my mouth.

1) Asian best friend who has strict parents, her mum doesn't speak English and then there was the line about how you couldn't understand what her mum had to do to get to America.

Am sure that is still true for some but this feels like a racial stereotype in 2021.

American teen movies love the nerds and jocks as much as they love the doe-eyed cheerleaders but it would have been better to see more than just a one dimensional trope for this guy.

Talk about one dimensional, this character was only used for animalistic over the top gestures or expressions. Think of an unloveable Donkey from Shrek but with zero dialogue and added sexual predator vibes.

I've been trying to log into my mum's netflix account after she changed the account details recently (the password, email address and billing account), but get ""incorrect password"" every time, even though I'm 100% sure I'm typing in the exact password she set like a day ago (she sent me the password, which worked for her, over text to copy and paste). It doesn't work on any of my devices but does on all of my mum's and my sisters'. (They live in another city than me, so that might be affecting things)

All I can tell about the show is that it has a complete different story than what you imagine at the start. The story, plot and characters are perfectly lined up. Definitely the life shown in Wellsbury is way more exaggerated. Though, Georgia had a dark past, but I really liked her character and how she strives to provide good life to her children. Ginny&amp;#39;s character is like every other Teenager. Austin is a silent character but he looks so cute in specs. And Ellen definitely reminded me of Jocelyn&amp;#39;s character. It has used some old jokes but surely a complete entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;

,netflix,"I suppose I shouldn't expect anything less from a Netflix series - but talk about a completely one-sided narrative that relies on wishful speculation.

It was evident from the get go this was going to be a series that was designed to pique your curiosity and spin a narrative that would engage more viewers which I can understand, but it doesn't make it any less appalling.

I think there are some people who would agree there is a simple explanation for what happened to her, but the amateur ""sleuths"" and ""internet detectives"" have forever dragged this poor girls' name through the mud, stained her reputation and the worst part is that Netflix gave them a platform to do so.

The interviewee crew all lack any sort of credibility on providing an expert opinion - we have countless YouTubers perspectives who are trying to perpetuate an alternative theory that will drive up their view counts, an internet dork who cries and obsesses over Elisa like he knows her personally and has suffered a huge loss - it just undermines what her poor family is going through and now this series will ensure they never move on from this endless tirade of shitty conspiracy theories.

The LAPD releasing that elevator footage is one of the worst mistakes they could've made in this case.

The entire reason being is that the footage is super ambiguous. When you rely on the same perspective to determine what she was doing in that elevator and how she was behaving, you unknowingly have just set a dangerous precedent for anyone who watches that footage.

There is a great theory that Elisa was playfully clicking all of the elevator buttons whilst on the 14th floor (perhaps after having a casual look around) and out of curiosity, slid her finger across a row of levels in the centre column and hit the door hold button.

She could've been confused, possibly a little flustered because she's on the 14th floor and the doors aren't closing. It has a reputation for being dodgy as the floors go up and maybe that's why she's hiding in the corner of the elevator.

She is also a vulnerable, depressed, bipolar woman who is hours away from her immediate support network and that might have exacerbated her condition.

There is a whole spiel that could paint a picture of her journey but we won't go into that.

Instead, the consensus focuses on her experimenting with recreational drugs, scared of someone/someone is with her in the lobby of the elevator, she was put in that tank by an unknown source, the LAPD is hiding the toxicology report because they are involved, a hotel worker is involved and might've coerced her to the roof, it's haunted and she was possessed to commit suicide, +100 more baseless theories.

Not to mention that a death metal musician, who yes, admittedly, posted some creepy shit, was being implicated as a ""murderer"" because of loosely-strung lyrics and music clips. He ultimately also tried to kill himself and was checked into a psychiatric hospital as a result.

I'm just disappointed that the last thing this case needed was another over-saturated, one-sided series that poses no credible sources or multiple points of view and Netflix gave this case a world-wide platform to do just that.

All this series did was ensure that Elisa's family will never be able to move on from this.

EDIT: I should clarify this post focuses on the sleuths and the conspiracy-pushing narrative the documentary had for a good portion of the series.

No error code or a cause for the error, literally just the word “error.” When I try to reopen the movie/show I was watching, the error shows again immediately without any playback. With the lack of anything descriptive, googling it hasn’t exactly been fruitful, so I came here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things I’ve tried:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Restarting the app (works for like 30 seconds and then it goes back to error)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

,netflix,"Welp, I'm prepared to receive a huge amount of reasons I'm wrong so here it goes...

(Spoilers Below)

Edit: I don't know why but my numbering isn't working properly while using RIF on my android. But consider them as 1, 2, and 3.



The Vanishing at the Cecil Hotel is flawed. It's far too long, repetitive, and the production overall is not that great. 

However, I would like to address the point of the series because imo it seems to have been misunderstood by many viewers on here. I'll start with this:

1. The series isn't actually about the Elisa Lam case.

While the series involves the case, it uses it as a vehicle to tell a different story of internet investigators. It is a cautionary tale and it is absolutely crucial that the internet sleuths got the screen time that they did. Many people might say that it's disgusting or repulsive or whatever that they were given this much attention. You can decide that yourself, but the attention was negative imo. Throughout the series they are clearly mocked, though in the beginning it appears as though they might be onto something which leads me to my next point...

2. Information is withheld from the viewer (us) on purpose and the reason for this would be lost if it followed the more traditional documentary style of telling all the facts in order.

Many people were angry that the info about the water tank lid being open wasn't completely addressed near the beginning when it was first discussed. While I, and many others, thought it was silly since the maintenance worker clearly had to have opened it at the least himself, it was good that they didn't tell us this one bit of info. This allowed for the conspiracy theorists to present multiple arguments that strayed further and further away from the case. Many saw this as straying further and further from the point of the series, but like I said before the case isn't the point of the series. By doing this it allowed the viewer to become more and more confused, possibly choose a theory that sounds plausible to them, or simply deny it all and agree with the facts provided from the police. This allowed for a recreation of the feeling when the case was still active where you are overwhelmed with information, like one of the officers explained. Being overwhelmed with so much information makes a fairly simple case like this seem much larger. It allows the viewer to become like the conspiracy theorists or deny it, but either way it produces anger. This anger is necessary which leads me to my final point...

3. You should feel angry at the end of the series. This is a true crime series where the viewer becomes an accomplice to the true criminals, the internet sleuths.

This is the most interesting part for me and is what makes me the most sad because it seems like many people aren't understanding it. I will reiterate that the series is deeply flawed but this aspect was done very well. But what I mean by this is that the internet sleuths make the viewers either question the case and become angry or make the viewer angry at them for spouting conspiracy nonsense. However, at the end of the series when all is revealed it becomes clear that the entire time these internet sleuths that claimed to be the good guys were actually the antagonists of the story. They are the true villains. Their screen time is to show you how deeply concerning it is to have people latch onto cases like this to hinder the investigation at best and ruin lives at the worst. While some regret their decisions, notice how none of them ever mention Morbid or say how their actions had severe consequences. They don't take responsibility for their actions and their obsession is destructive in a very criminal way. One of the sleuths even talks about how he visited Lam's grave for closure. Clearly this person is not healthy even after everything they believed is proved wrong. They are in denial because they don't want to be the bad guy. They don't want to accept the truth or that their actions have consequences. This is what made me furious and I hope it made you furious as well because this is a never ending tale. This is just one example of how destructive people can be online when they are arrogant enough to think they know more about a case than the professionals investigating it. The video of the one youtuber saying ""I have reviewed this case for hours and I completely disagree with the coroner"" is a perfect example of how delusional an average person can become when they get sucked into a web of lies. It's also an example of how these sleuths are being mocked because they clearly are part of the problem. While the sleuths might have thought they had screen time for their ""research"", in actuality they had screen time so we can see first hand how someone that does this thinks and acts.

Conclusion:
This series is not traditional true crime. It's a stretch to even call it true crime. But it is very clever in disguising itself as true crime to get it's point across.

Yes it has a lot of issues, it drags often, it's repetitive, it has poorly done production in parts but it is not irresponsible like many have said. If anything, it's more responsible than most true crime series out right now. It's not glorifying the case, it is demonizing those that distorted it for internet clout or other personal satisfaction. You're allowed to still dislike it though, this doesn't make it a good documentary but I felt it deserved a fair defense for what it's goal was. Personally, I don't even know that I would recommend this series unless someone is already interested because it does drag a lot. But again, the anger it builds inside of you is necessary and on purpose.

But what I mean by this is that the internet sleuths make the viewers either question the case and become angry or make the viewer angry at them for spouting conspiracy nonsense. However, at the end of the series when all is revealed it becomes clear that the entire time these internet sleuths that claimed to be the good guys were actually the antagonists of the story. They are the true villains. Their screen time is to show you how deeply concerning it is to have people latch onto cases like this to hinder the investigation at best and ruin lives at the worst. While some regret their decisions, notice how none of them ever mention Morbid or say how their actions had severe consequences. They don&amp;#39;t take responsibility for their actions and their obsession is destructive in a very criminal way. One of the sleuths even talks about how he visited Lam&amp;#39;s grave for closure. Clearly this person is not healthy even after everything they believed is proved wrong. They are in denial because they don&amp;#39;t want to be the bad guy. They don&amp;#39;t want to accept the truth or that their actions have consequences. This is what made me furious and I hope it made you furious as well because this is a never ending tale. This is just one example of how destructive people can be online when they are arrogant enough to think they know more about a case than the professionals investigating it. The video of the one youtuber saying &amp;quot;I have reviewed this case for hours and I completely disagree with the coroner&amp;quot; is a perfect example of how delusional an average person can become when they get sucked into a web of lies. It&amp;#39;s also an example of how these sleuths are being mocked because they clearly are part of the problem. While the sleuths might have thought they had screen time for their &amp;quot;research&amp;quot;, in actuality they had screen time so we can see first hand how someone that does this thinks and acts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conclusion:
This series is not traditional true crime. It&amp;#39;s a stretch to even call it true crime. But it is very clever in disguising itself as true crime to get it&amp;#39;s point across.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes it has a lot of issues, it drags often, it&amp;#39;s repetitive, it has poorly done production in parts but it is not irresponsible like many have said. If anything, it&amp;#39;s more responsible than most true crime series out right now. It&amp;#39;s not glorifying the case, it is demonizing those that distorted it for internet clout or other personal satisfaction. You&amp;#39;re allowed to still dislike it though, this doesn&amp;#39;t make it a good documentary but I felt it deserved a fair defense for what it&amp;#39;s goal was. Personally, I don&amp;#39;t even know that I would recommend this series unless someone is already interested because it does drag a lot. But again, the anger it builds inside of you is necessary and on purpose. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading, have a wonderful day :)&lt;/p&gt;

I'm constantly amazed that a company with Netflix's resources can't seem to make an app that doesn't crash or run sluggishly. I unsubscribed from Netflix a year ago because their support was utterly clueless and told me the workaround was to unplug my Roku TV for 1 minute every time the app acts up. Well, that would be fine if it actually fixed it but it doesn't.

So before I start heading back in the unsubscribing direction, does anyone have a clever way to get their garbage app to actually function?

**EDIT:** Scroll down to kneelray's advice. Turning off the auto-play features (options available only through the website) appears to have completely fixed the lag and crashing. Log in to the Netflix website and then go to **account &gt; profile &gt; playback settings &gt; change** and turn off the auto-play features.

1. They have multiple “internet sleuths” as experts. Now, I’m all for the internet sleuthing movement, and I don’t mind them being interviewed if they played a roll in the case (like that don’t mess with cats show), but somebody just blogging about a case does not make them an expert.

2. Somebody said “I’ve spent hundreds of hours on this case.” So a week? You spent a week? So what?

3. Somebody else said they’ve spent hours on the case and disagree with the medical examiner. Jesus, who cares if you do.

4. Multiple people claiming she isn’t acting like she is bipolar because they haven’t seen someone who is bipolar acting that way before. Wow.

5. They are OBSESSED with the hatch being open and claim that’s proof she was thrown in. Um...why couldn’t she close it herself as she went in? Why is that deemed impossible and ignored? Is it more likely it would be left open in that case? Sure, but that doesn’t make the other option impossible.

6. Apparently the Cecil is a hell mouth. They act like evil is drawn there or some bullshit.

I love a Netflix doc drone shot as much as the next guy, but this is seriously one of the most unnecessary true crime docs I’ve ever seen. This story has been done to death before this doc, and if I can get the whole story in a 20 minute YouTube video, you have to give me a reason why you are making a 4 hour doc about it.

Edit: I wanted to say I posted this while starting episode 4. Spoilers, but for them to basically all admit it was probably just an accident and explain why EVERYTHING they brought up in episodes 1-3 was wrong really drove home the pointlessness of this show. I really liked how they handled the story of the musician though.

Edit 2: Those of you saying “you missed the point, the internet sleuths were bad,” you are giving this far too much credit.

&lt;p&gt;I love a Netflix doc drone shot as much as the next guy, but this is seriously one of the most unnecessary true crime docs I’ve ever seen. This story has been done to death before this doc, and if I can get the whole story in a 20 minute YouTube video, you have to give me a reason why you are making a 4 hour doc about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: I wanted to say I posted this while starting episode 4. Spoilers, but for them to basically all admit it was probably just an accident and explain why EVERYTHING they brought up in episodes 1-3 was wrong really drove home the pointlessness of this show. I really liked how they handled the story of the musician though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit 2: Those of you saying “you missed the point, the internet sleuths were bad,” you are giving this far too much credit. If that was the point, they wouldn’t have spent 3 eps letting those sleuths spew every conspiracy theory they could think and then let those exact same people debunk them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I appreciated how much better the characters got fleshed out after a few episodes, and the build-up really pays off in the last part.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, It is still soapy and messy in many ways. But I would say it&amp;#39;s an enjoyable show to binge, above average at least.&lt;/p&gt;

,netflix,"[Here is a screenshot](https://imgur.com/gallery/0dJP8Vc) of chat explaining to Netflix support that they upgraded my account to premium without me knowing. 

Today I noticed my account was charged 17.99 instead of the usual 13.99 price I pay for standard service. I looked on my account and noticed I had premium service now. Only my wife and I use the account and neither of us upgraded the service since we don't need more than 2 screens at once. To double check if maybe we forgot about doing it, I used the search bar to look through my email for Netflix email confirming the change; none were found. 

So I downgraded the service back to standard, lo and behold I received an email right away confirming the change.

&lt;p&gt;Today I noticed my account was charged 17.99 instead of the usual 13.99 price I pay for standard service. I looked on my account and noticed I had premium service now. Only my wife and I use the account and neither of us upgraded the service since we don&amp;#39;t need more than 2 screens at once. To double check if maybe we forgot about doing it, I used the search bar to look through my email for Netflix email confirming the change; none were found. &lt;/p&gt;

,netflix,"Hello,

It is known that Chrome, FF is limited to 720p for whatever reason. Edge is able to play 1080p and up to 4K. It does play 1080p on my more modern machine, bus fails to go higher than 720p on my older one (1607 build, 6600K, GTX960).
Yes, Win build is ancient, but I'm fine with it, as is suits my needs.

Anyway, I used IE11 on both machines and it played 1080p perfectly fine until one week ago. Now IE11 does not play videos at all (demands to install Silverlight).

&lt;p&gt;It is known that Chrome, FF is limited to 720p for whatever reason. Edge is able to play 1080p and up to 4K. It does play 1080p on my more modern machine, bus fails to go higher than 720p on my older one (1607 build, 6600K, GTX960).
Yes, Win build is ancient, but I&amp;#39;m fine with it, as is suits my needs.&lt;/p&gt;

,netflix,"Just came across this OpEd by Chris Lambert, that helped me understand the reasoning behind the filmmakers' decision to include footage of the web sleuths in the ""*Vanishing...*"" Netflix documentary about Elisa Lam. Reddit is mentioned, which really got my attention. Here are some excerpts:

&gt; There is controversy around the Netflix documentary about the death of 21-year-old Elisa Lam at the Cecil Hotel in Los Angeles back in 2013. It mainly centers on the inclusion of “web sleuths” and YouTubers featured in the 4-episode *Crime Scene* series. The controversy boils down to two factors.  
&gt;  
&gt;First, the web sleuths and YouTubers do not come off well in the documentary. Overreaching, obsessive, irresponsible, infuriating—those adjectives about sum up the bulk of the reactions I saw others have (and felt myself).  
&gt;  
&gt;There’s a whole Reddit post with TWENTY-THOUSAND UPVOTES and over 100 awards (kind of a big deal in the Reddit community) that’s titled, “Why I stopped watching the Elisa Lam documentary.”

The point of the article, and I'm paraphrasing is that one explanation for the reasoning behind including the web sleuths is ""Show, don't tell"". 

&gt;So imagine if *Vanishing* simply told us the web sleuths and YouTubers were annoying. Maybe the detective or journalist would say, “The online sleuths and YouTubers spread a lot of misinformation that caused a lot of issues.” We’d probably believe them. But that statement wouldn’t make a lasting impression on us. It’s information rather than experience. There’s no action. No demonstration.  
&gt;  
&gt;Berlinger is very aware of the power of experience. So he brings in the sleuths and YouTubers, letting us see, first-hand, what they’re like. And, yeah, they make your blood boil.

Reddit is mentioned, which really got my attention. Here are some excerpts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is controversy around the Netflix documentary about the death of 21-year-old Elisa Lam at the Cecil Hotel in Los Angeles back in 2013. It mainly centers on the inclusion of “web sleuths” and YouTubers featured in the 4-episode &lt;em&gt;Crime Scene&lt;/em&gt; series. The controversy boils down to two factors.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the web sleuths and YouTubers do not come off well in the documentary. Overreaching, obsessive, irresponsible, infuriating—those adjectives about sum up the bulk of the reactions I saw others have (and felt myself).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a whole Reddit post with TWENTY-THOUSAND UPVOTES and over 100 awards (kind of a big deal in the Reddit community) that’s titled, “Why I stopped watching the Elisa Lam documentary.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point of the article, and I&amp;#39;m paraphrasing is that one explanation for the reasoning behind including the web sleuths is &amp;quot;Show, don&amp;#39;t tell&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So imagine if &lt;em&gt;Vanishing&lt;/em&gt; simply told us the web sleuths and YouTubers were annoying. Maybe the detective or journalist would say, “The online sleuths and YouTubers spread a lot of misinformation that caused a lot of issues.” We’d probably believe them.

,netflix,"**SPOILER ALERT x SPOILER ALERT!!**

So, I've finished the 4th episode where the psychiatrist David has fired the assistant Louise.

I am loving the series because the acting is amazing, the shots are beautifully done and the character building is so amazing that it'll kill you with slow burn! But it just seems to have a lot of unanswered questions that keep increasing. Does it answer everything in the end or I'm supposed to take those hints and turn them into facts?I think it's taking tooo long to put clarity in the context.

For example:- Adele dreaming and finding that David is cheating on her. Is that a supernatural power or just guestimate dreaming?- Adele waking up from multiple dreams inside dreams (like inception). What's up with that?- Rob dead in the forest (wearing the clothes he was wearing with Adele).

&amp;#x200B;

Hope it's all worth it in the end!

,netflix,"I’m a pretty big history buff and have studied the sengoku jidai (Japanese Warring state period) on my own. That being said I’m no expert or anything, just a hobby historian. I also understand making documentaries dramatic and stuff. But I wanna give my opinions on this show’s first episode as I haven’t seen anyone else talk about it yet. If y’all are interested I’ll make a post about my final thoughts on the series when I finish it.

Historically speaking. They get a lot of facts right. I like that. They give exact events. People involved, people’s death, battles, who was related to who and in what manner, etc. That being said there’s a handful of subjective stuff that feels like it’s pandering towards weebs. I’m a bit of a weeb myself so I can identify weeb pandering when I see it. Saying the Samurai were the best warriors in history? The katana is the finest sword ever made??? This is stuff hardcore weebs say just because they think everything Japanese is best. Don’t get me wrong, I admire the katana and respect the skill of the Samurai, but you can’t label anything as the best when it comes to history because it’s much more complicated than that. Granted it’s subjective, but it feels like pandering. There’s only one hard thing they try to sell as fact that’s just blatantly wrong. Nobunaga was not the first person to use Ashigaru. Ashigaru had been around for a long time and were extensively used by every faction during this period of Japanese history. They’re also a little off when it comes to weapons. I do like the accuracy when they talk about guns. The specific number Nobunaga used, the advantages and disadvantages, and they weren’t wrong about how Nobunaga helped normalize the use of guns. And while the katana is definitely an iconic weapon every samurai used, they kinda passed up spears/pole arms and the bow. The samurai used bows extensively and I don’t even think they mention it. Bows were one of the reasons others didn’t use guns, because it was said in the early days “a skilled bowman could loose 15 arrows in the time it took a musket man to reload”. Everything else I really like and they did a good job portraying most informative.

When it comes to cinematography I have really just two things to say. This looks great...except why is it so grey and dark. The costumes, the acting, the choreography, everything is great, except this dark filter they have on everything, even the historians talking. Idk why but I personally found this kinda stupid and annoying. I think it’s because it feels like they were trying to go for a Ghosts of Tsushima vibe which makes me feel like this was pandering a little bit. Aside from that, everything else looks great. Normally I’d complain about the chaotic battles with no formation, but the battles they depicted were in fact quite chaotic in the forests so I actually don’t have a problem with that.

Overall I like the show for the most part, it’s mostly accurate but misses a couple things. It does feel like they have a very specific audience they’re trying to pander to at times. Show is too dark and unnecessarily grey, but the costumes and action are amazing.

,netflix,"I'll start off that i liked The last airbender.... But i loved The Legends of Korra. 

I never watched cartoons or any shit like that. i remember seeing eps of TLAB when i was a teen, but never invested into it. Jumped on nextflix around December and saw it. So i was like hmmm its familiar and something to catch up on, then i saw The Legends Of Korra. Now i was told it was crap and blah blah, but im no sheep ill find thing out for myself. I'm not a super hard guy, but i dont break down unless its a pet or loved that has died. 

&amp;#x200B;

Korra put me into tears... and her ending felt more like a Cliffhanger then a ending. I Mean she says ""there is soo much i want to see and do as this new avatar"" She grows soo much and suffers alot during the way. every enemy she faced took away apart of her. she went from this bratty kid to a strong compassionate woman. And her Love with Asami.... 

&amp;#x200B;

We need more of that. I'm not even gay it feels wrong we cant see them share a kiss or be inlove... We all want to see Korra and Asami be in love, we also want to see this new mature compassionate avatar in at least 2 more seasons. What could a future story arc be?

Well do the comics but with animation... Comics are fillers, not story tellers, these comics take to long and rush through everything. I mean there is bugger all story... anyway Animate the comics fill them out give them more story... 

Then the last season we see Korra at 26 awaken from a nightmare seeing Aang fight off dark spirits. Asami is woken up by Korra to ask what happened. for korra to just say it was a past lifes nightmare... She might no longer connected to them but she is still a part of that cycle... 2 days later spirits start pouring out of a portal for Korra to investigate, She goes and askes a spirit what is going on it replies with ""your kind as destorying the spirit world"" Korra replies ""humans have not been destroying the spirit world"" the spirit would reply with ""NO! your kind avatar!"" So this could be a season where she finds out the past lives wernt destroyed... they where disconnected from Rava when she was destroyed....   
Rava is a nexus, she connected all the Past and current avatars together, and when rava died. they thought Korra died in avatar state and the cycle was broken.

These past lives went out into the spirit world to find other avatars that where out and got lost when this all happened. and 80% that left were caught by bad spirits that had messed with avatars and imprisoned or devoured them...

,netflix,"Hi All,

I recently got a 4k TCL C716 TV mainly to watch Netflix in 4k. TCLs packaging has the Netflix logo all over it so assumed its officially compatible. The quality of the TVs software is awful (not been updated in my region, full of security holes) and one of the remotes was broken.

Anyway, when I watch FHD content - i.e. shows that support 1080p only - it looks really good. But when I watch any 4k content then there is a ""static"" or coloured dot effect over the whole picture which is extremely noticeable. This effect isn't noticeable in YouTube or other apps. There also doesn't seem to be a way to force the TV to play 4k content in 1080p (although obviously this would defeat the point of the TV!).

I checked the TV Netflix app and it reports 90Mbps to Netflix. Fast.com from a web browser reports 33Mbps (compared to 430Mbps on the computer....), however, in video stats say 15.25Mbps. It doesn't look like a compression artifact though.

I talked to Netflix support and they weren't able to suggest anything. I'm really confused if this is likely to be a Netflix app issue, the TV just being generally bad (wouldn't recommend TCL) or something else.

Wanted to see if anyone on here has the same experience or any suggestions?

I just wanna focus on the incredible and improbable mess that occurs after Marla and Frankie are apprehended by Tyrion's men and how it heavily relies on a major dose of suspension of disbelief. 

1. Marla says the easiest way to solve their issue is for Tyrion to pay her 10 million and they both go their ways. Tyrion rejects that and decides to kill her. Wouldn't the actual easiest option be to simply force Marla to sign some sort of legal document releasing Ms Peterson from her guardianship? Marla definitely has a way to accomplish this as we see in the end that Ms Peterson is released from the psychiatric facility and reunited with her son. Also, Tyrion's men already have Frankie so they could somehow use that as leverage to force Marla into giving up. 
2. Anybody who has ever seen a crime movie (or has the tiniest bit of common sense) knows that a henchman/hitman would make sure the person they are told to kill is actually dead. However, both for Frankie and Marla, the henchmen apparently simply thought it was over and went about their nights. Would have hurt for them to stand by the lake and make sure Marla did not somehow escaped? Would have hurt for them to stand by the apartment until it blew up?
3. Are we really supposed to believe a middle aged woman (would say the same thing if it was a middle aged man) was able to single-handedly defeat the security team of Russian mobster? Not only that, but it was somewhat convenient that right when Marla was at the driver's house he was about to leave to meet Tyrion. It was very convenient that the bathroom Marla asked the front desk guy about was in the direction of a door towards the executive parking promptly open by someone else. And it was extremely convenient than in a massive office building with a bunch of parking levels she was able to find exactly Tyrion's driver right around the corner. 
4. A Russian mobster only has one security guard? 
5. How did Marla end up at/find the hospital where Tyrion was taken and how she managed to be assigned as her legal guardian so they could have this extremely productive business meeting?

It might not seem like it, but I did enjoy the movie and felt like it was going in a great direction right before this mess. Guess that's what happens when you just can't figure out how to tie everything up for the conclusion.

It would be a great visual representation to see the connections and relations of the tribes.

The Crows are located near Barthok --&gt; Berlin (and eastern Germany probably)

The Femen are south-west of them, near Leipzig, if I am not mistaken

The Crimson should be somewhere further to the west, correct? I think we don't know where their new capital is located (Ahrenberg) - if i would guess, probably somewhere in Benelux, since they spoke Dutch in the 2 episode. --&gt; But they were also next to Little Praha, which would be to the south of Crows again...

There is the northern Kingdom (probably Skandinavian?) where the life is great, as Moses says

,netflix,"I just got finished erasing from my Ipad the fictional cast and their relation to each other. For those who have not seen it, this is from memory, but it might help you avoid rewatching the first two episodes. The story is told in flashback from 2017, when literally everyone in the isolated Alpine town of Valmoline comes together to celebrate a marriage between two couples: Manu and Adele; and Laurent and Erika (see below).

**1997**\-- The chalet's tenants: **Jean-Louis Rodier** (writer, not from Valmoline); **Francoise**, (his wife, **from** Valmoline); **Julien** (the Rodiers' thirteen-year-old son); **Amelie** (their very young daughter). **Alexandre** (Francoise's hermit cousin).

Town locals: **Philippe** (a former admirer and perhaps lover of Francoise) ; **Muriel**, (his unmarried sister); **Florence** (Philippe's shopkeeper/souvenir-hut-owning wife); **Etienne** (a guy in love with Muriel and angry at her instant infatuation with the suave Jean-Louis); **Christine** (a relation, possibly sister, of Etienne). **Milou**, Valmoline's cabinet-maker, employs **Gaspard**, who drinks a lot with Philippe and Etienne. Milou is the father of the coveted young Alice, rivalry over whom brings Julien (see above) to blows--and then some--with Sebastian, Laurent, and Thierry.

The integral adolescent cast includes as thirteen-year-olds Philippe's sons, **Laurent** and **Thierry.** They do not speak in the 1997 segment but appear as ""muscle"" for the local bully, **Sebastian**. Sebastian is Etienne's son and in love with **Alice.**  Finally, there is **Manu**, not a local boy, but one whom both Alice and Sebastian claim as BFFs during Manu's summer visits. The viewer never meets Manu's parents.

**2017**\-- Laurent brings **Erika (blonde)** to a train station in Chambery. They are going to marry in Valmoline (God only knows where :). Thierry brings **Tiphaine (redhead)**, his girlfriend. Manu, having already arrived by car with **Adele (blonde)**, greets his business partner, **Olivier**, and Olivier's partner **Mathilde**, and her very young daughter **Leonore**. Sebastian also arrives by car with **Maud**, a gorgeous  and friendly showroom model in the car-importing business Sebastian has built for himself with funds whose source the unfolding series eventually explains.

One final local, **Paul**, seems to be a postman who travels back and forth (in both 1997 and 2017) between Valmoline and the outer-world.

If I were to suggest which characters are integral to this mini-series--without giving away any of its mystery or plot--I would suggest you pay attention to **Jean-Louis**; **Muriel**, the young **Philippe**; and, in 2017, **Alice** and **Sebastian**.

Additionally when I select the show off the menu, the default episode is always the very last episode, even if I go back to the very beginning and play the first episode from the beginning. The episode will end, nothing will play, and when I go to select a new episode it's always on the last one (and plays from the end credits). It's pretty frustrating because the episodes are only 10 mins long, and considering he gets limited TV time I'd like for it to be something he enjoys.

,netflix,"Spoilers if you haven't watched it...

&amp;#x200B;

I've tried to put my thoughts into words, but I'm also not the best reviewer so.. yeah:

I watched the Cecil Hotel documentary the other day and when I finished it, I felt frustrated. The more it’s come up in conversation, of which has not yet been very positive, I’ve felt a seething anger at the documentary more and more and I’ve come to the conclusion that it’s not even bad, it’s just outright disrespectful and imo a disgusting approach to telling a story.

First of all, the actual documentary is \~decent\~ and as somebody who knew the bare minimum of this case (based on spooky videos I watched when I was 15), I felt rather informed by it. Its first two episodes do a good job in telling the situation of the case, the context is a bit mix-matched and the manager makes me uncomfortable, but overall, the set up and the story of the case was a standard documentary. I’m pretty sure I could have stopped there and felt pretty satisfied with the documentary.

However, its primarily the third episode which frustrated me the most, or at least it’s complete tonal contradiction to the final episode. You see, part 3 explains the different theories based around Elisa Lam, which are all highlights of Web Sleuth culture. Ridiculous theories based on silly information, which is fair enough if you’re covering this topic and all – but to entertain these theories is completely disrespectful to the following episode, which I will touch on soon. At no point does it really give any sense of validity to these ideas and ultimately, they’re played off as cooky conspiracies, which I won’t lie – they pretty much are. I spent the duration of the ‘horror movie in action’ theory rolling my eyes and actually muttering to myself “and what?”, because it’s stupid. The theory Elisa Lam was a secret agent sent to spread TB? Good movie plot about corruption, bad take on a woman’s tragic death. It also entertains paranormal activity and all these ridiculous ideas, and it angers me so much.

The primary issue I have with episode 3 is that it is quickly followed by a huge tonal shift, centred around a message about Elisa Lam’s mental health. It’s only until episode 4 we learn a lot of key information for what most likely happened (her medication, her depression, her strange activity). Episode 4 appears to set out about mental health and its connection to this tragic tale of a woman’s death. We even see Morbid who may discomfort me with his art style, but nonetheless is a victim of the web sleuths. And while the episode appears to focus on this and focus on the crippling affects it had on him, it still entertained these ridiculous notions the episode earlier. It glorified these people, despite the next episode having this façade and pretence of passionate take on mental health. It’s disgusting.

It’s completely problematic and I’ve not seen such a half-assed and shallow message on mental health in my life. Were this a documentary about the Cecil Hotel alone, it would work with an episode or a segment on Elisa Lam, detailing the case and how she met her tragic fate related to her suffering mental health, it would work. Were this ultimately a take on web sleuth culture, the crippling damages it can have on the web sleuth, the people they pursue and the investigations they seek out, it would work. But no. Instead, the final episode concludes the intended message of mental health, as though it hadn’t spent the past episode entertaining such ridiculous theories for an hour. It acts as though it skipped past the affects on Morbid. It shed no light on the family, their struggle dealing with the loss of a daughter and a sister – nor her friends. In the end, the documentary is a disrespectful and shallow attempt to entice web sleuths into an internet mystery and ultimately wrap it up in a nice, cute message about awareness to mental illness, as though the makers really cared about that final message, as opposed to explaining the mystery?

I genuinely have so many issues with this and it really angers me how they approached this genuinely tragic story. I do think the historian and I believe sociologists (I may be wrong, but the woman who discusses Elisa Lam and the man who discusses the homeless population in skid row) were on right tracks of approaching this story. The web sleuths seem so detached from the actual case and I can’t explain how uncomfortable it is to see one of the main web sleuths say how he had someone go to her grave and touch it for him, as though she’s barely a person? I don’t know, it’s just the web sleuths don’t feel as though they fully understand what they’re in the midst in and while I appreciated one of the web sleuths’ reflections on his actions, the whole ordeal fully showcases why you shouldn’t entertain these theories, because you attract detached people from the original case. They felt inconvenienced and ultimately dissatisfied with the likely answer, which is apparently is the ultimate message of the documentary?

Maybe I’m overthinking it, but I’ve actually never been so outraged in my life by a show and the more I think about it, the more frustrated I get? I think the documentary is okay, it’s pretty bad but it’s actual case study (bar episode 3) somewhat works. It’s interesting, but it’s focusing on the wrong thing, which ultimately makes its final message feel super disingenuous. I feel informed, which a documentary should seek out to do, but these producers had this final episode in mind when shooting the 3rd, and yet despite having dedicated the final episode to a mental health message, still entertained these ridiculous and irrelevant, ungrounded and frustrating theories.",t2_6baukxll,False,,0,False,The Vanishing at Cecil Hotel is problematic and absolutely terrible,[],r/netflix,False,6,,0,,False,t3_ll2d3m,False,dark,0.85,,public,59,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,59,,False,,1613478121.0,,[],{},,True,,1613505608.0,text,6,,,text,self.netflix,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spoilers if you haven&amp;#39;t watched it...&lt;/p&gt;

I don’t know, it’s just the web sleuths don’t feel as though they fully understand what they’re in the midst in and while I appreciated one of the web sleuths’ reflections on his actions, the whole ordeal fully showcases why you shouldn’t entertain these theories, because you attract detached people from the original case. They felt inconvenienced and ultimately dissatisfied with the likely answer, which is apparently is the ultimate message of the documentary?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe I’m overthinking it, but I’ve actually never been so outraged in my life by a show and the more I think about it, the more frustrated I get? I think the documentary is okay, it’s pretty bad but it’s actual case study (bar episode 3) somewhat works. It’s interesting, but it’s focusing on the wrong thing, which ultimately makes its final message feel super disingenuous. I feel informed, which a documentary should seek out to do, but these producers had this final episode in mind when shooting the 3rd, and yet despite having dedicated the final episode to a mental health message, still entertained these ridiculous and irrelevant, ungrounded and frustrating theories.&lt;/p&gt;

,netflix,"Ron Howard's new docusieries goes above and beyond to show the desperation to teach everyone what mental illness is. Heres a deep dive.

At the center of this murder mystery is one of the most bizarre surveillance videos you'll ever see, showing 3 or 4 minutes of the last known movements of a missing Canadian 21 year old woman traveling in LA at a Skid Row hotel. But in this current pandemic-driven era of binging and intense, en masse thought provoking, it was actually more fascinating to me getting to know the multitude of narrators. Because when we step outside the world of toxic polarizing politics, we see that as human beings, its far more important and interesting to glean how and why people act how they act, and what these behaviors say about people. Here's some things and people I found fascinating!
1) The Cecil Hotel Manager - OK let's get this one out of the way 1st- everyone is going to have an opinion about this woman- she's a TRIP! Possibly the most naive person on the face of this Earth, (she comments about the hotel she runs on Skid Row, ""I saw an officer with his gun drawn in the hallway and was like 'wait what's going on here?""), she is someone I want to grab by the shoulders on around 2 dozen different occasions and shake (softly!) and say ""How are you just realizing this?!? Wake up girl!."" But I think it is wrong to not point out that this is a girl from the middle of the country that has no city experience decides to go into the heart of skid row Los Angeles one of the most dangerous places in America and take over a hotel with the worst reputation imaginable and make it a better place and she's the woman up for that job. That takes courage that takes balls that I wish I had and that I wish we all had. My hat goes after her Come out with all her eccentricities, she at times comes off as flawed but no more or less than any of us. 
2) Conspiracy theories- These days it seems like maybe because of the time everybody has on their hands that conspiracy theories are more rampant than ever before. Now, I started thinking, how many conspiracy theories have ever come to light as actual explanations to mysteries? Maybe somebody out there can point to things once considered conspiracies theories that turned out to be true, but I know of none. In this case, we see how true this is. The name of the 
3) Paranormal Activity, and the proclivity to assume it does actually exist, and is to blame for negative or strange events. I blame nobody for believing what they want to believe that is a right that we all have. But assuming paranormal activity might be at fault for anything that has happened will put you in a rabbit hole that will never end in a positive manner and for those that do believe in paranormal activity, Maybe it does maybe it doesn't, but let's not swear our credibility on it. Especially in a missing person case. 
4) Web sleuths. Here is a great example of how grouping people into one type or moniker is usually never a good thing to do, because not everybody who decided to try and help this investigation was necessarily hurtful to the investigation or guilty of pointing pointing their finger at innocent people. Now this isn't to say that We shouldn't feel sympathy for the metal singer who was falsely accused and put some blame on those who made his life so difficult that he attempted suicide. But I have to point to 2 things in this docuseries that really are heartwarming. The couple that films the hotel Really does fascinating and helpful work that, Had she been murdered could have opened a lot of doors as to the reason. 
But the star here is John Siobhan, the soft spoken, mild mannered person that took interest. When he mentions that after reading her blog how he felt heartbroken and infuriated at the same time we come to know him and realise that here is somebody that is so empathetic and so smart... How come we all don't raise our children the way his parents did so that he came out that way? And how come we don't make him president of this country for life because I fell in love with this person during this film and if he ever happens to read this my hat goes off to you sir you are the best of us.
5) Coincidences. Oh, you darn coincidences. David Lynch once wrote in Lost Highway, ""I don't believe in bad coincidences. Coincidences spook us out for sure because they are mathematical anomalies. But here's the thing, if coincidence didn't exist then somebody mathematic like myself would be really worried because it is an absolute certainty that the more people on Earth exist, living their lives, the more mathematical coincidences will occur. And the more people there are LOOKING for answers to things, the more coincidences there will be. Coincidences exist, you'll run into plenty in your life, and they'll be just that, random, mathematical coincidences. 
6) Mental illness, and its prominence in society- As someone with a fairly severe mental illness, I know far more than I want to about mental illnesses. Over the course of my life, having spent several days in treatment facilities, it became clear to me early in life that mental illnesses are no different than physical ones in their degrees of harmfulness, except that they're easier to ignore because they aren't physically noticeable to others much of the time, as they're occurring in the afflicted's brains, hidden from the world, and only actually provable in a brain scan. But its important for those unafflicted to become more aware that the behaviors of those that are. 
This is even more evident when these youtubers start Commenting about how her bipolar disorder definitely could not be the reason that she was found dead. Here's the problem, these people that say this clearly have never met anybody or cared about anybody who is afflicted with bipolar disorder. It is one of the most savagely terrible things that can occur in the brain and can cause the best person in the world to act as irrational and dangerous and poor mannered to act unruly. As soon as Her death is ruled because of her bipolar disorder, there is a frenzy of doubt that pops up and that really points even more directly to the fact that people who don't know how serious and how potentially deadly serious chemical imbalances are. And it almost doesn't matter whether that is actually why she died or not, The bigger issue here is that Mental illness is something that needs to be destigmatised, talked about more in AND out of the medical community, and FAR more money needs to be allotted by the government to help those afflicted. 
But as I can attest to personally, When somebody has mental disorder even the most loving parents are left in the dark most of the time and if they don't have the time and resources to do the research it's very hard for them to realise the real degree of severity of their child's illness. Elisa's parents NEVER Should have allowed her to travel on her own. Now of course she was an adult and she could do whatever she wanted to, But this is why it's even more important to make sure that parents are well aware and understand early on that they are going to have to do things that most parents won't even deep into their child's life to help protect themselves from a sickness that there is no cure too and that there is only differing degrees of help for, And in a lot of cases as we tragically see here, it is so easy for somebody with mental illness to not take their medication even for a short period of time and have their behaviour change radically on a dime. Obviously her parents are not to blame, but I think what we need to take from this is that it is just a terrible tragedy how little amounts of information and help are out there that need to be. 
I think Elisa would want nothing more than to have helped change these unfortunate, terrible facts. And my hat goes off and I just have so much love and respect for Ron Howard and Brian glazer who made this movie. I believe they are well aware of how tragic mental illness really is and how much more information and attention and money and help and all of that needs to go to mental illness and they wanted to help and they realised that just talking about it has yet to work. So by putting this absolutely fascinating documentary together, that pulls anybody who watches it into it, By the end, hopefully you take this away from the movie. Was a loving good person that was trying to find herself just like we all do at that age and she wanted to travel and she had ambition and she tried to make something happen that would improve her life, but because mental illness is still to this day just a huge stigma that The vast amount of the public has no idea about how serious and how silent and hard to notice mental illness is. Read about it. Watch this film. Accept That it was mental illness that caused her death and that you might know somebody or several people that are afflicted and just bof them and realise that they may not be acting in A way that they want to or that reflects who they are.

I’ve known about both the Elisa Lam and the Kenneka Jenkins cases for a while now. When I first read about the death of Elisa Lam, maybe for the first few weeks or so, I was convinced that she was killed. However after spending a lot of time researching the facts of the case and hearing almost every opinion that there was, it just makes sense to me that she died accidentally.

I have seen every surveillance video, every report, every witness statement, every autopsy photograph, every social media post, pretty much every single thing that has been released to the public in compliance with the Freedom of Information Act. 

Still with all of this information, nothing convinces me in the slightest way that she voluntarily went into that freezer and stayed in there until her death. There is just no way.

,netflix,"I'm having a difficult time finding decent shows on Netflix lately. I think the quality has been deteriorating for awhile. They give celebrities or famous people huge production deals instead of finding fresh new talent. Almost all the shows or movies that I watch now are foreign which says something about the quality of the U.S. shows and movies. I recently watched Hinterland, The Woods and a few others. 

When I saw the trailer for Red Dot it looked interesting so I decided to watch. It was clear from the beginning that their assumption that the racist brothers were responsible was wrong. But it's not clear if the brothers were helping the person who actually wanted to kill them. The brother who is also a rescue person points a gun at them as if he is going to shoot them while they're hiding but then he is surprised when he seem them captured and about to be killed. The other brother is confused when Nadja starts backing away from him so he doesn't seem involved. 

When the brother enters the room where Thomas has Nadja and David he is shot by Thomas and David rushes over the untie Nadja. David has a power drill in his hand. Wouldn't it make more sense to kill Thomas with the drill while he is fighting with Jarmo? And why did it take so much time for Thomas to go after Nadja and David after they escaped? He wasn't injured so he must have quickly killed Jarmo. But the most frustrating part of the movie was the ending. It would have preferred the pregnant woman lived but is it believable that an intelligent woman in medical school would be overwhelmed with passion that she would attempt to fondle her boyfriend's penis while he was DRIVING A CAR.

,netflix,"Netflix really needs to do a better job of advertising this Original.

If you like Guardians of the Galaxy, Anime or Star Wars, you should watch this one.

Its a fun space action adventure, the CGI is a little bit dated but they use it sparingly. 

The movie borrows alot of its visuals from Guardians, The Fifth Element, and a little bit of Snow Piercer. The characters are very much inspired from generic sci fi anime characters.

Act 1 is kind of a cliché sci fi slog but the film really hits its stride in Act 2...

Its a fun movie! Korean Cinema loves to appease cinephiles. Half the movie is in English and the other half is korean, for those of you adverse to subtitles. Its like they wanted to make a easy to watch action adventure movie that could get people who dont like subtitles to watch. And i think they accomplished their goal. They made a Scfi action romp with anime influence that tries to appeal mainstream audience.

,netflix,"Reverse footage tells everything, she is in conversation with someone on right, then, she enters the elevator, pretends to go away. Then comes to the corner, checks if the person has left and then lives the elevator and heads to left.

Also, why didn’t they investigate all the guest during Elisa lam visit, isn’t that standard procedure to check who all were there, including staff.

How come police checks about dumpsters but doesn’t check water tank while investigating. 

I am convinced, the hotel staffs were involved in drug trade and police took their cuts from the trade.

,netflix,"# Trust,

Is important in relationships, Trust is hardcore, without trust, your partner would most likely be [carried away by a big bird](https://twitter.com/mindflakes/status/1152165761554821120), and unless you want that to happen, trust them.

This is exactly what’s conveyed in “To all the boys, Always and Forever: The movie”. It’s about trust and love and hope and fighting problems and Lara not letting Peter get carried away by a big bird and vice versa.

It’s also about having such a relationship that neither of you hold each other back. The movie definitely is a bit of a cliche but it’s a good type of cliche.

**It’s the type of cliche that you don’t mind it being a cliche- the good times, the sad times and despite the pain and the process- everyone gets a happy ending.**

It’s a perfect Valentine’s day watch, especially if you’re single- it can give you a bit of an insight into how relationships actually work- how the relationships that last, work.

This movie is basically about Lara Jean getting accepted into a college far away from Peter’s. They wouldn’t be able to see each other everyday, unlike what they’d first envisioned and it’s clear the both of them think that the separation would get to them, signalling the end of their relationship.

**The entire series is something people can relate to- getting embarrassed by your boyfriend’s ex who’s so clearly jealous of you, parent issues, school issues, your boyfriend’s issues, your sister issues, your issues- no matter how tiny all these problems may seem compared to the big plot- it all adds up.**

It’s all relatable and it’s all happening in the blink of an eye- this just makes the movie 2X exciting.

The final film Always and Forever serves the Internet generation.

Like a conventional high school rom-com, it has a damsel in distress, a charmingly protective boyfriend, fears of separation and a flashy prom. Yet it manages to be refreshing and enjoyable.

This movie is a successful example of how you can make cliche’s work, both by defying them and by abiding by them.

All of Lara and Peter’s decisions are doable, you yourself would have made the same decisions if you were in their shoes. The aesthetic of the movie is also something to talk about- it’s a classic Lara Jean aesthetic- pink and blue and yellow and green: the aesthetic of the movie also makes you want to stay. It also has a satisfying ending

**With this, if you are on the lookout for a cute, slightly cliched rom-com that might make you cry a little bit- To All The Boys Always and Forever is the perfect movie for you.**

,netflix,"I just watched this limited series last night and for my opinion its not the best series i have watched and also not the worst i mean there are some good stuff in the series but i think netflix should've just made this a short length film. So i made a list of what are the best parts and what are the worst parts of the series.


Best Parts

1. How they found Elisa Lam's elevator footage 
2. Two europeans show the the experience at the hotel
3. The history and related stories about the hotel (including Skid Row)
4. Analyzing Elisa Lam's steps of how she got to the water tank and how she got to the cecil hotel instead of Stay on main hotel.
5. The police investigating the whole hotel (well kinda the best)

Worst/Cringey Parts
1. The Youtubers/Bloggers ""acting"" like detectives and using Elisa for content and money which is very offensive.
2. Too much useless information
3. Making Elisa Lam's tumblr posts public
4. Police investigation at the Cecil hotel's rooftop
5. Too much unrelated and off topic theories
6. The internet users are being to personal like the guy that said ""I felt like i lost a sister"" and the other people who just denies the test result and blame other people for Elisa Lam's death.
7. Very bad video editing

So i will talk about the bad/cringey parts only. 

I hate that the Youtubers/Bloggers keep acting like detectives but does not do what a detective was supposed to do they literally didn't do anything to help to the LAPD like they just literally go to the hotel and walk around and they even go to the parts of the hotel where he/she/they should not even go to.

And i also hate the guy who made the facebook group about Elisa Lam because he was being to personal and i really think he was faking it because what kind of guy or girl would share their personal feelings to the public you will just literally get more hate for that.

I also hate the people who denies the test result like they know how to this stuff i mean what they only know is to make damn useless theories and most importantly of how they blamed that artist who literally lost his career because of them and got hate messages for 7 years straight. 

I love that they put many information to this series but some of them are just not that important and will probably just waste your time.

Whoever are the police officers check the rooftop should have been more responsible just because your dog doesn't smell anything you still need to check the water tank.

And they should've have not made Elisa Lam's tumblr post public because again it was like a diary to her meaning its personal and you should not share it to the public no matter what.


So even if the LAPD, Government and the Cecil hotel employees made mistakes i still blame the internet users for this because they literally used Elisa Lam for content and money and they literally ruuned tge lives of the people they blamed. And about the General Manager i feel her it wasn't easy to change a hotel full of serial killers and homeless peopleand if she gets used to it it's still a very hard task so the real antagonist of this case are The internet users who denied the result, blamed innocent people and used Elisa Lam.

My rating for this mini series is
4.5/10

I'm European, I live in Britain, where this show is based.

In Europe, there's no such thing as Hispanic, all Europeans are white-Caucasian.  
Spain, Italy, Portugal- do not refer to themselves as Hispanic or POC.

You can find many articles on this on the web from Spanish people going to America and going from White to being called Hispanic/ being segregated from who they are and how uncomfortable they feel.

Does anyone know if i can download a older version of netflix on ios? i have a older version on another ios phone if that helps. I tried googling it but no luck.&lt;/p&gt;

We have old tenants speaking about the rooms, neighborhood, and history of the place. We have Skid Row experts piping up about the area throughout the years, and we have an incredibly weird ex-manager of the Cecil who (IMO) seems to be doing the interview to prove something.

,netflix,"Basically title. Sometimes I can make it through an entire episode, sometimes not. Happens with the official app or viewing through the web browser. No other video service causes this. Movies &amp; TV from Microsoft, Disney+, Hulu, Amazon, etc. Can binge for hours with no problems. No issues gaming or doing anything else. It's literally just Netflix. 

Any fix to this? I've Googled it and seen similar reports going back several years at this point, but no resolution. I don't know if it's even been acknowledged or is being looked into. 

Basically what happens is the video will freeze. Sometimes the audio will skip like a broken record and other times it will keep playing normally. If I close out of the app the computer immediately hard locks and nothing works. I have to reboot it by holding the power button. If I just leave the app it will continue for about 30 seconds with the same end result. Leaving it, X'ing out of it, ending the process via Task Manager all cause the hard lock. 

Anyone have any insight into what is going on, why or could we at least get someone to look into it? It's super annoying when I have to do this every 1.5 episodes of something.

,netflix,"I think it was a good show nothing special. But I really didn't like how it obsessively focussed on their personal lives and soft side.

All the major characters are shown dressed so clean, talk so eloquently and are diplomatic and business-like. But it doesn't AT ALL show the wild side of Mexico's drug scene or the absolute daily brutality in which drug lords execute their strategies.

All the scenes are so slow and dramatic, it just begs you to consider it cool and epic without any substance backing it up. The charcters don't feel dangerous or interesting because we don't see the wild side of them - it's ""too cinematic"" and needs that wild gritty realistic underground edge that is the Mexico drug scene

When I compare it to movies/shows like......

* Traffic (2000)
* Sicario
* The Sopranos
* No Country for Old men
* City of God
* Requiem for a dream

......Narcos just feels really flat, predictable, basic and lacks that wild intensity that other crime/drugs movies have

&lt;p&gt;First reason we want to work this project with Netflix is because we don&amp;#39;t have the budget do continue with the project.* In other words we need money *&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main question is. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How should a pitch for a film idea to Netflix be? What do we share with them?&lt;/p&gt;

1. Going in I believe she may have already gotten an idea for the area and that’s why she seems so on edge. I don’t think she was being followed. 

2. They talk about her possibly being in something because of her moving her hands and whatever. Now personally I’ve been lost in a daydream conversation before and I’ve caught myself moving my hands and occasionally talking out loud but somewhat mumbly. She also was bipolar so that may have been a factor in the behavior as well. 

3. With her hiding I believe that to be her hearing footsteps, she pressed a lot of buttons and the elevator stopped working. (Which I’ll just say I think the elevator was just shitty and had a moment).

4. With the shoe I believe that was somebody that showed up and was possibly waiting there for someone/something. I don’t believe she knew this person.
