**The Disney+ Discord Server recently expanded.** We now include channels for other streaming services, including Netflix, Hulu, and Paramount+. To gain access to these channels, you will use our #role-selector channel. Our expansion also invites a new name: **Cordcutting &amp; Streaming TV.**

We started this discord server in August of 2019, just before the Disney+ launch. Since that time, we have seen our server expand to nearly 2,000 individuals. We have had great conversations about the service, including troubleshooting and content like *The Mandalorian* and *WandaVision.* This Discord is a merger of our current server and those run by partner subreddits. We realize that most of us subscribe to multiple streaming services. A Discord dedicated to each streamer fragments the fandom. This expansion now creates a united community where you can talk with fans of *The Mandalorian, Picard,* and *Bridgerton* alike.

To gain access to channels relevant to you, you will use our #role-selector channel in the Discord to pick the channels that are relevant to you and avoid the others. We hope that the expansion will enrich our conversations.

DisneyPlus,"Change streaming quality for each profile I'll say it how it is: My internet is shit and there's nothing I can do about it! That's why my family only streams 1080p movies when we watch stuff together. If everyone's doing their own thing, then we just use 480p/720p out of courtesy. I set up one profile for each person and an extra one for the living room TV.

It's possibly to change the streaming quality in the ""app"" settings (4k, 1080p or 480p) but that seems to be the same setting for the whole account.

How do I change it individually, for each profile?

With Netflix it's possible set to the quality individually for each profile and no matter if you use the profile on your phone, the TV or even through the website/Windows app, it uses that quality. With Prime you can set the streaming quality directly (while the video's playing). Youtube: Well, all the settings you'd ever wish for! But how do I do this with Disney+?

I was however able to access the feature whenever I however my control in the Disney + app on my home screen on TV.

I called Disney+ and for two hours, the customer SVC officer was talking to the tech support and back and still nothing. Unplugged the tv while it's on and unplugged router. Waited 5 minutes and still nothing. 

So the only thing that works now is if I delete the app and reinstalled back on the tv. But the minute I turned the TV off, and back on, screen is blank. Disney + works fine on my computer and phone. Works fine with Roku app. I checked to see if the other apps on Samsung are having the issues, including the preinstalled ones, all are working fine.

Plot was really compelling. Scenery was gorgeous. Animation was stunning (it's crazy how far they have come). The Background Music was the best I've heard in an animated film.

But it had quite a few flaws that were apparent throughout the film. Needed more choreography (very grounded choreo but there was barely any of it). Too much tell not show - a ton of exposition to get us through the story. Comedy was a little forced. Ending was rushed (so much potential), where everyone just ""fixed"" their problems because a few people saved the day when no one else could notice it and now dragons are back so let's stop fighting so much.

* **Service:**  Disney+
* **Country:** The Netherlands (Service provider: KPN)
* **Steps taken:** Updated apps and performed Power-Cycle (several times)

When I watch Disney+ content on my Chromecast Ultra I experience almost always buffering. This buffering happens a few times an hour, almost always in groups of three or four within a minute or two. When I watch Netflix content on my Chromecast Ultra I never see buffering, not even when I watch 4K content.

I have a 100Mbits glass fiber internet connection from KPN (The Netherlands). I watch Disney+ on the Chromecast Ultra which is cable connected via a switch to my modem by CAT5e cables. When I connect the cable to my laptop instead of the Chromecast and measure the speed I get this result:

The switch supports port mirroring so I mirrored the port which connects to my Chromecast to my laptop and used Wireshark to analyse the stream.

When I stream e.g. a Disney+ episode from Perception, this is what I see (the red arrows mark the moments when the movie freezes and the timeline appears at the bottom):

The duration on the x axis is in all three cases about 280 seconds. The maximum peak hight with the Disney+ stream is about 10Mbits. With the Netflix 4K stream it is also about 10Mbits and with the HD content about 4Mbits.

DisneyPlus,"DisneyPlus is a terrible disappointment for PC users Well, that's unless you have a 720p monitor and enjoy watching movies in that quality.

Let's put the conclusion up here, so you only have to read the following essay, if you're interested in the details of this impertinence. The maximum streaming quality you'll ever get as a PC user is 720p. There is currently no pc in the world setup that'll change anything about that. Even if you meet their ridiculous HDCP requirements (see more about that topic [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DisneyPlus/comments/i3u7hf/hdcp_is_horrible_and_whats_even_worse_is_its/)), you'll be served with their finest 720p streams. Even if you buy their premier access, which I gladly did because I love Disney's animation movies, you'll witness video quality on the level of a 2012 YouTube video. But not a single word about that is mentioned on their [support page](https://help.disneyplus.com/csp?id=csp_article_content&amp;sys_kb_id=8c5be2abdbab0cd8abf8c58a13961902) about the requirements for full HD or UHD streaming. 

Disney may "" love 4K as much as \[I\] do"" (quote from the support page), but they certainly don't love PC users as much as I do.

 

Let's go through a few of the results that pop up if you search for this topic on google.

1. A Reddit post on this very subreddit of which the top comment sums up what PC users can demand from a service such as DisneyPlus: ""There is no way \[to stream Disney+ at 4K on PC\]  till there is a windows app out"". I find it hilarious that you can find the UPW Xbox app in the Microsoft store which you cannot download because Disney didn't have the courage to bring it to PC (roughly speaking [UWP Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/get-started/universal-application-platform-guide) run on every device running Windows 10).
2. A bunch of websites and guides claiming to give you working instructions on how to actually get 4k on a PC. These tutorials are all outdated if you properly update your computer and your browsers. Disney may have provided 1080p streams to the UWP version of Edge (basically the old Edge that wasn't based on chromium), but that legacy version is no longer maintained by Microsoft and cannot be used with the latest Windows versions. The streaming quality with Edge and Chrome is now equally bad.
3. If you then order DisneyPlus and realize that the streaming quality is horrible, you'll search for the reason why you won't get 4k or 1080p streams and you'll find [this](https://help.disneyplus.com/csp?id=csp_article_content&amp;sys_kb_id=2a467817dbef849860f3eacb139619cd) support article. Disney is brazen enough in this one to tell you, that you should make sure you're not using an inline video player. Seriously?! I would like to avoid inline players as well, but it's the only thing Disney is offering to PC users. A plain old webapp with inline video players. 

And as always the reason for this mumbo jumbo nonsense boils down to copyright protection.

My Disney+ monthly subscription got cancelled because my CC expired. Because of that I was being charged the price for new customers instead of the price for current customers (which will be available until August). When I contacted the customer support to understand why I was being charged 8.99€ instead of 6.99€ that was the answer.

I would understand if they told me that it was not possible to reverse as it was an automatic process. That answer just made me not wanting to keep the subscription at all.

DisneyPlus,"Watching Firefly again - is Disney plus finally the platform to continue to develop stories in the Firefly universe? Firefly is great. There should have been more seasons.  But there wasn't.  It's too late now for the original cast to pick things up and continue on, but there's no reason other stories can't be told in this universe.

It would be great to see not a reboot, but a continuation of stories in this universe.  (I.e. like Star Trek Next Generation compared to the original Star Trek).

My thoughts for the hook would be for a new crew to become a new family on Serenity (or perhaps another Firefly class ship) who could continue the fight against the central alliance.

DisneyPlus,"The Simpsons lines are pretty bad I know I have seen a few posts about issues, but I wanted to share a post with 2 pictures comparing the DVD copy and the Disney+ copy. We all know about the aspect ratio issues, but in some cases I see they have not only darkened / thickened the lines the processing increased the shadow around characters sometimes making them pop off more. I describe it as looking like a sticker on-top of the show. I think season 8 is where I so the most of this sticker like appearance, sadly that's the one season I'm missing from my 1-9 collection and couldn't use that for comparison.

Anyway here are two images to compare (I hope the reddit upload retains most of the quality):

Taking a close look at homer, he appears to really jump off the screen due to all the shadowing around his body. My eyes were also drawn to the very thick lines, making the drawing feel almost more aggressive than it's original softer tone. I appreciate all the work Disney+ has put into making this show ""HD"" and the amount of noise removed is very good, but I think the sacrifice of bad lines makes it worse than watching the SD DVD. I'd really appreciate it if Disney would take a second look at The Simpsons and provide a little less aggressive processing on the drawing lines.",simpsons line pretty bad know post issue want share post picture compare dvd copy copy know aspect ratio issue case darken thicken line processing increase shadow character pop describe look like sticker think season sticker like appearance sadly season miss collection use comparison image compare hope reddit upload retain quality close look homer appear jump screen shadowing body eye draw thick line drawing feel aggressive original soft tone appreciate work hd noise remove good think sacrifice bad line bad sd dvd appreciate second look simpsons provide little aggressive processing drawing line,244,0.01742063492063492,positive,1

DisneyPlus,"Is this really the best Disney can do? No one is saying Disney is lacking content or anything. Content wise, Disney is Disney. They own everything, so of course they have plenty of content. 

My beef, is that their app, at least on PS4, is hot garbage. 

Autoplay has been broken for a month, since it was broken in an update. I just downloaded the latest update today...Still broken. Known issue, that should be easy enough to roll back and resolve...Still broken a month later. 

You have any idea how frustrating it is to stop what you're doing every 5 minutes, so you can hit a button, so your kids can watch that next episode of Bluey? Cute show, but episodes are about the length of a commercial, and manually intervening 10 times an hour is cancer. And now, fresh new pain in the butt, it doesn't even start the next episode. It just keeps playing the same episode over and over again. You can't select which episode you want to watch from the drop down list, and continue watching just keeps resetting the same episode. That's not available from the continue menu.

Now that sucks, but you know what's worse? When you watch the last episode, it just disappears from your play list, and you have to search for it again. Now, despite you having searched for the same title a dozen times this week, the app still makes you jump through the hoops. There are streaming services that probably shouldn't track your search history. This isn't one of them. 

Cool, you've found the show again. Hit play. Maybe 10% of the time, you're met with the blue spinning wheel of shame. Sorry, we can't load that content at this time. Why? Because the app is a ""heavier"" stream than any of the other services, and struggles from time to time, even with high speed internet.

Again, I'm not here saying ""Disney bad hur dur."" It's great to watch a cartoon from your childhood with your own kid, and the content selection is good, even if it's pretty lacking for adults. 

The problem is, that relative to Hulu, YouTube, Twitch, Netflix, and Amazon, Disney has the worst app. There's no reason that they should have such inferior delivery of their content, after they've been around this long. 

And it's never acceptable for updates you release into production to keep breaking things. Sure it happens sometimes. But every other company in the world doubles down to fix their mistakes. Leaving features broken for a month, that you broke during an update, while raising your prices at the same time? Any other service would be hemorrhaging subscribers. 

But it's Disney...And they've got all the content...So our subscription remains. It would just be nice to see them keep up with every other service on the technical side.",good lack content content wise course plenty content beef app hot garbage autoplay break month break update download late update today break known issue easy roll resolve break month later idea frustrating stop minute hit button kid episode bluey cute episode length commercial manually intervene time hour cancer fresh new pain butt start episode play episode select episode want drop list continue reset episode available continue menu suck know bad episode disappear play list search despite search title dozen time week app jump hoop streaming service probably track search history cool find hit play maybe time meet blue spinning wheel shame sorry load content time app heavy stream service struggle time time high speed internet bad hur dur great cartoon childhood kid content selection good pretty lacking adult problem relative hulu youtube twitch amazon bad app reason inferior delivery content long acceptable update release production break thing sure happen company world double fix mistake leave feature break month break update raise price time service hemorrhage subscriber content subscription remain nice service technical,475,0.03619973318086527,positive,1

DisneyPlus,"Raya and the Last Dragon - Film Discussion Thread “Raya and the Last Dragon” takes us on an exciting, epic journey to the fantasy world of Kumandra, where humans and dragons lived together long ago in harmony. But when an evil force threatened the land, the dragons sacrificed themselves to save humanity. Now, 500 years later, that same evil has returned and it’s up to a lone warrior, Raya, to track down the legendary last dragon to restore the fractured land and its divided people. However, along her journey, she’ll learn that it’ll take more than a dragon to save the world—it’s going to take trust and teamwork as well.

Don Hall and Carlos López Estrada are directing, with Paul Briggs and John Ripa co-directing. Osnat Shurer and Peter Del Vecho are the producers, and Qui Nguyen and Adele Lim are the writers on the project.

Walt Disney Animation Studios’ “Raya and the Last Dragon’' will be available on Disney+ with Premier Access in most Disney+ markets, at the same time as it is released in select theaters on March 5, 2021.

DisneyPlus,"Continue watching from where you left off I have an issue with Disney Plus. 
I haven't had any other streaming services except from Netflix (and Netflix seems to work exactly as it should when it comes to this, 100% of the time), so I don't know if this is a usual thing. 

Just like Netflix, Disney+ has the feature that lets you keep watching an episode from where you left off. 
But Netflix, is ""smart"" enough to know when it should just get you to the next episode. (if you closed an episode during the credits, the next time you open the series, it'll just show you the next episode).

Disney+ doesn't do that. It will start the episode exactly where you left off, even if you shut it off during the credits. If they at least had a button that lets you skip to the next episode at any point, it wouldn't be as big of a deal. But they only have the little window at the end of the show that does that, and if you reopen an episode that you closed during the credits, that little window doesn't even appear. 
So you either have to watch all the credits or go back and scroll through the list of the episodes to get to the one you want.

I was enjoying using Disney plus until this morning when I got an error message sending me to the help centre.yesterday I had signed into another Disney app with my Disney account and I was prompted with a thing to put in my age I accidentally put my age as a 15 year old instead of my actually age of 22. 
I thought nothing of it as I didn't think it would have an affect on anything.

I contacted the Disney plus help service and apparently my account has been flagged as a minor and there is absolutely nothing they can do to change the age and the only solution is making a new account and paying for the new subscription price after the original one is refunded by Google.

If anyone's knows a way I can change the account age or get someone with high up authority to change the account age to over 18 or my age 22. Hopefully this post will reach someone that will have the solution.

Sure, the current versions of the Star Wars movies, especially the early ones, are definitive enough already.

Some changes such as the whole 'Greedo shot first' debacle are legendary enough already.

Has anyone encountered these 2 issues after the last 2 updates? An update came out and the next episode button disappeared, now to see the next episode of something I have to go back to the list and look for it because otherwise, it keeps playing the last 10 seconds of the end credits of the one I was watching before. When an episode ends, there's a ""skip credits"" button that doesn't always appear (nor work) and it's half ""out of the screen"" (I can only see part of it). I tried changing my settings thinking maybe the issue was with my screen ratio, but it's the right one and even if I change it the button is still in a weird position.

Then a new update was released and I hoped it would fix the issue but nothing changed, and now I have subtitles in the middle of the damn screen. For reference, I'm currently watching Bones - but it happens with everything, I tried.

DisneyPlus,"Found an awesome picture on Disney+ but can't save it There is an amazing background picture of Mando that I saw after The Mandalorian S2E3 ""Chapter 11: The Heiress"" – in the transition screen that prompts you to see the next episode. I'm really interested in setting this as my desktop wallpaper. Here's what it looks like:

[Screenshot of the picture in question](https://preview.redd.it/0017sb5rw0l61.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8fed8a6a6d4cd3055865e00cbd92c01518a88546)

As you can see, the picture on-screen is obscured by some UI-elements of Disney+ (Edge browser on PC), so taking a screenshot wasn't really getting me anywhere. And I quickly discovered that you can't just save it down either. I tried everything I could; searching via the browser's web developer inspection tool and doing a reverse image search with 3 different sites. Nothing worked. It's also extra-difficult because that transition screen where the picture appears only lasts 10 seconds until the next episode is automatically played – and there is no way to pause it. I also contacted Disney+ support to ask if they could send it, but the support agent said that wouldn't be possible. Curious, that such a simple request couldn't be satisfied.

By any chance, is someone able to provide this image or an idea on how it's possible to save it down?

DisneyPlus,"Dolby Atmos or HDR? This is my conundrum with 2016 hardware in 2021.

-Devices:

-TV: Sony X930D

-Streaming device: Firecube TV

-AVR: Yamaha RX-A3050

-Oppo 203 4K Disc Player

-Services: Disney+, Prime Video

-Country: USA

-Steps Taken: Playing around with all sound configurations and trying out different hardware for solution.

Ultimately it comes down to one or the other.  HDR picture over object based audio.

My tv is limited to compressed audio through it's arc return.  So the most I'll hear is compressed 5.1 dolby digital.  But I'll get HDR.

If I use my Firecube TV through my AVR, I achieve Dolby Atmos but HDR doesn't look as vibrant as natively steaming content from the TV OS itself.  This could be solved by updating to a TV with EARC return.  (Potentially up to a $2,500 upgrade). The same can be said about upgrading the receiver.  Because the receiver may require a EARC port as well.  (Potentially up to another $2,000)

I should note I tried my PS4 Pro playing God of War in HDR between the AvR and the TV directly and noticed the same dim appearance running HDR content through the AvR.  I did attempt a work around.  By running my PS4 into my Oppos HDMI in, then running the players HDMI out to the tv directly, I achieve full HDR with Atmos audio (when available) as a 2nd hdmi out is sent to the AvR. But this is a tedious process. I have to turn on the TV, the AvR, The Oppo, set input on the Oppo to hdmi in, then check the AvR audio is set to the Oppo and then I can finally get the full av experience my current equipment can handle.  I'm not even sure I can program a logetich smart remote to follow all those steps to simplify this experience.

The idea should be for Disney to incentivize a continual subscription and dis-incentivize drop-in/drop-out subscriptions.

So how about this:

Every month you maintain your subscription, give customers a ""premier token"" or however you want to call it. After you accumulate 3 tokens, you can buy premier content like Raya or Mulan or whatever.

Existing customers get rewarded for maintaining a subscription. New customers get the incentive to stick around instead of binge WandaVision and drop.

And of course, if people really want to drop $30 on a movie instead of hitting the theater, you absolutely let them.

But metadata issues are another  thing all together and any help compiling and reporting them would be appreciated. particularly since I have no ability to go through STAR's library due to living in America and I'm guessing it brought with it tons of issues.

**Release Dates:**

* New Girl  (2011) is listed as 1999!!!
* Disney Illuminations Fireworks is listed as 3000!!!

**Titles:**

* Roll it Back (Shorts) is mistitled Disney Roll it Back (Shorts)
* So Random (2011) is listed as Sonny With a Chance (Season 3) when it was actually a spin-off and separate show. All VOD sites have it properly listed as its own show.

&amp;#x200B;

**Misc:**

ANT Farm Season 1 episode titles do not have ANT capitalized in them - but seasons 2 and 3 do and the full series is formatted correctly on all VOD sites.

&amp;#x200B;

**Missing (Non-banned) Episodes: \[Not a metadata issue, but I'd love help reporting these\]**

* Little Mermaid episode (1x01 - Whale of a Tale)  is not banned or lost - it's available with the rest of the show on all digital VOD sites where the rest of the show can be purchased.

DisneyPlus,"A Warning to Verizon Promotion Users Hi all! 

I wanted to share my recent experience with Verizon to try to save someone else the hassle. 

I signed up with Verizon and got the free year of Disney+. Great! I planned to cancel after the free year and then eventually sign back up with Disney+ directly. 

My year was up in February. I received a reminder email from Verizon about the free subscription coming to an end on February 2 stating my promotion ends February 16. 

So, February 15 I try to cancel. No way to do it online, so I have to call. Ugh. I spend about 30 minutes on a call to get the Disney+ removed from my account (which included having to re-setup my auto pay and other annoying steps). 

Now, I receive my March Verizon bill and I see I am still billed for Disney+. I chat with a representative today and find out apparently my Verizon bill is generated on the 12th of each month, so even though I canceled my Disney+ before my free promotion ends, I have to pay for it for a month, but then it will be removed from my March bill (and going forward). 

I realize this is only a $7 charge, but it’s the principle of the matter. I tried to get the charge removed or a discount for the next bill, but Verizon refused. SO, instead, I’m coming here to warn other Verizon users of my experience to try to save someone else this frustration.

DisneyPlus,"Two step verification and passcode Hi, I’ve been using Disney Plus for a while now, and I really love it. I’ve shared my subscription and password with two of my friends so that they can use it too.

The problem is that they again share the password with their friends/“leaks” the password/logs in on their friends devices and forget to log out. Suddenly, a lot of people I don’t know, have access to my subscription.

I really wish Disney Plus would have the option to turn on two step verification, for two reasons:

1: Security

2: I could give my friends my password, but they would still need me to send the verification code each time they try to log in, which would give me a lot more control of how many devices they log in to, and how often.

————————————

The second thing I want to say, is that now that Star got introduced, I noticed Disney added the option to create passcode for each profile. (Which I think are great). The problem for me, is that the passcode can be seen/reset if you just type in the subscription password, which my friends got access to, meaning they can still access my profile, even though I create a passcode. (Of course, I understand that the passcode is meant for kids not getting access to their parents “18+”-profile, but I think it would be great to be able to keep other persons away from the profile too)

How I would like to see this improved, is for example receiving a confirm-mail, that you would have to confirm to be able to see/reset the passcode. An other way is using two step verification to see/reset it.

————————————

But if anyone knows any other smart ways to log in your friend with your Disney Plus subscription, without giving him the password, and without being in the same room, I would really appreciate you letting me know.",step verification passcode hi use love share subscription password friend use problem share password password log friend device forget log suddenly lot people know access subscription wish option turn step verification reason security friend password need send verification code time try log lot control device log second thing want star introduce notice add option create passcode profile think great problem passcode reset type subscription password friend access mean access profile create passcode course understand passcode mean kid access parent think great able person away profile like improve example receive confirm mail confirm able reset passcode way use step verification reset know smart way log friend subscription password room appreciate let know,324,0.27120535714285715,positive,1

UPDATE: The parental controls and 18+ content went live for me at 10.20pm. Hopefully it’s live for other Canadians now, too!

Couple of quick observations:

Looks like Buffy the Vampire Slayer is the much hated HD upscale instead of a new transfer. Not a big surprise.

We have all episodes of Futurama - the four TV movies have been separated into episodes and listed as 'Season 6.'

There’s definitely some stuff here which wasn’t on the content lists released last month. For example, Bob’s Burgers wasn’t on the Canadian content list but we do have a couple of seasons.

* Steps Taken: I've checked all my language/subtitle options, they're all set appropriately. Used it on multiple devices to find the issues.

So the problem I'm having is, when I watch disney+ on my PS5, any on-screen text gets accompanied with a subtitle for another language, I'm not sure which one it is, but it looks like it's either german or danish.

It happens like, in the Simpsons, in S31E07 when  the whale talks, it has english text on screen normally that's baked in from the show, but then I also get the black bar subtitles translating it to another language at the top of the screen.

This issue doesn't happen on the PC when I watch the videos though.

I've also noticed that, on most shows, on PC or PS5, the end credits of the shows are in another language.

Of course I forgot to write it down all together. I had originally wanted to catch it in the actual theater, but you know. ANYWHO. Logged in last night to watch the latest WandaVision and there it was bold and beautiful. 

THE BOOK OF LIFE. 

Added it to my list immediately so I wouldn’t forget to watch it at some point this week. In between everything else I have going on. 

Today was a really bad day for me. Everything I did went horribly askew until I finally decided I was giving up for the day and was just gonna hide under my blankets and drink what’s left of my special whiskey. By this point I had forgotten I added the movie to my watch list all together. 

Went through all of my other apps looking for a show or movie to distract me for a bit. Completely forgetting I now have the Disney app. Couldn’t find anything. Felt defeated. Spent a good few minutes just staring at my tv and all the PlayStation stuff displayed on it (my ps4 is my gaming, my tv channels and my music box) anyway as I sat there zoning out like a zombie?

I got the notification ding. 

Looked up and saw that the Disney app was installing its update. WAIT!! THAT’S RIGHT! I’VE GOT THE DISNEY APP.!!! DUH!

I’m only 26 minutes into the movie and it’s GORGEOUS. It’s funny, it’s creative, it’s educational and I had to hit pause to post this here because I think anyone and everyone who is subscribed NEEDS to watch this movie.

does anyone of you here happen to know how i am able to change the overall account language?

I am able to watch movies and series in my favourite languages (german/english), but all mails (the UI is not affected) send by Disney+ are in Dutch. I guess it is because of the location during my registration, since i was in the netherlands during my registration, but my residence is in germany and my mothertongue is therefore german...

Changing this to german or english would be great.

DisneyPlus,"Subtitles Not Working Device: PS4
Service: Disney+
Country: US
Steps Taken: Updated App, rebooted device, deleted/redownloaded App, adjusted device settings

My Disney+ app on PS4 updated on 2/18. Since the update my subtitles have gone missing. I tried turning them off and on again while streaming but to turn them off I had to select “off” twice, and it was unsuccessful. I have restarted the app, rebooted the PS4, deleted and redownloaded the app, and adjusted the accessibility options on the PS4 to display subtitles as specified by content. Nothing has worked. 

While watching a different title last night I was able to select the Español subtitles, which worked, but we can’t read Spanish so they were unhelpful. When I tried to switch to English, they became both English and Spanish and took up a large portion of the screen. I was able to get just the English subtitles to work only for that title, and they were in large black text boxes, not large semi-transparent like they had been before the update. 

We aren’t hard of hearing but we do have small children, and we find the subtitles helpful for myself and my wife after the kids go to bed and we have to volume low, and to help the kids learn to read - they are seeing the words and hearing them at the same time. My oldest has pointed out that there aren’t words on the screen and is asking me to get them back. Any explanation or assistance would be much appreciated.

DisneyPlus,"Who is Disney Plus for exactly? I’ve been wondering who Disney Plus is making content for. When it first came out, I remember hearing that it would be exclusively for children and families. That there would be no R rated or adult themed content. 

But they have had the Simpsons from the very beginning and the Simpsons is not really for kids. Marvel movies are usually PG-13 and not appropriate for all ages. 

The main thing that makes me wonder is The Right Stuff. This original series portrayed a lot of scantily clad women, men cheating on their wives, sex scenes (or moments leading up to sex, not simulated sex scenes), lots of drinking alcohol and general behavior that is unbecoming for the characters/not setting a good example for children. 

I have no problem with any of it. It was a good show. But definitely adult-themed. I just don’t understand why Disney would produce this show while simultaneously killing the Lizzie McGuire revival because it was too adult themed. 

The show was going to feature Lizzie going through a divorce because her husband cheated. I assume it would focus on her raising her kids while having a career and also dating and would probably show the impact divorce has on kids, while also being a funny family show. (By the way, is the script available to read online? I’d like to read it!)

I’m also aware that Disney chose to release Love, Victor and High Fidelity on Hulu because those shows didn’t fit their family-friendly model. I’ve only seen Love, Victor, but didn’t find it especially adult themed. It featured teen LGBTQ characters, so it definitely feels like Disney is saying LGBTQ characters are not family friendly. (I’m also aware of the gay character and modern family dynamics on Andi Mack so I know they’re somewhat okay with these themes.)

I just don’t understand how they decide what is and isn’t family family friendly. I don’t love the idea of Disney cornering the market on “family friendly” content when their values seem to differ widely from my values and the values I would want to share with my kids. 

To go back to The Right Stuff vs Lizzie McGuire, we could interpret it as Disney being willing to portray men having realistic lives while not wanting to portray women having realistic lives. Or that it’s okay to see husbands cheating from the men‘s perspective but not the wife’s perspective.

How can they justify the hypocrisy? Or is there no hypocrisy and I’m misinterpreting? Is Disney Plus supposed to be exclusively for kids and families or not? What ultimately is their business model?",exactly wonder content come remember hear exclusively child family r rate adult theme content simpsons beginning simpsons kid marvel movie usually appropriate age main thing wonder right stuff original series portray lot scantily clothe woman man cheat wife sex scene moment lead sex simulate sex scene lot drinking alcohol general behavior unbecoming character set good example child problem good definitely adult theme understand produce simultaneously kill lizzie mcguire revival adult themed feature lizzie divorce husband cheat assume focus raise kid career date probably impact divorce kid funny family way script available read online like read aware choose release love victor high fidelity hulu fit family friendly model love victor find especially adult themed feature teen lgbtq character definitely feel like lgbtq character family friendly aware gay character modern family dynamic andi mack know somewhat okay theme understand decide family family friendly love idea corner market family friendly content value differ widely value value want share kid right stuff vs lizzie mcguire interpret willing portray man realistic life want portray woman realistic life okay husband cheat perspective wife perspective justify hypocrisy hypocrisy misinterpret suppose exclusively kid family ultimately business model,442,0.22852607709750572,positive,1

DisneyPlus,"Ideas for new shows As much as I like Star Wars and the MCU, I think that DisneyPlus will need big budget series that are not part of these two franchises, so here are three shows I would like to see in the future:

\- **A prequel show about the Incredibles**: I am actually surprised Disney hasn't announced this yet. A prequel show about Mr. Incredible and the good old days where he has to face different threats with Frozone and eventually meets his future wife Elastigirl.

\- **A Pirates of the Caribbean show**: Give this franchise the same treatment as Star Wars and focus on a TV show instead of more movies. If they could use the stagecraft technic for the water scenes they could keep the budget reasonable.

\- **A show about the Eragon books**: The books are far from perfect and they would have to adapt them carefully in order to make them work as a TV show but I would love to see a show that features dragons. In my opinion this will be the next logical step if Percy Jackson turns out to be a success.

DisneyPlus,"DisneyPlus Streaming Service (Opinion) So I scrolled through a bit of this subreddit, and looked at some of the hot and new posts. Most of the posts seem to read like marketing material instead of actual human interactions. I'm not sure if it's because I haven't been on Reddit very much, or if this is more just exclusive to this subreddit's ecosystem.

Outside of the subreddit, the actual streaming service doesn't seem all that great to me. The UI is  clunky (not as bad as Amazon Prime, but that's a low bar), there's no reviews available on the app for any shows or movies to avoid wasting the viewers time and expectations, I mostly just get recommendations for the same Disney properties I've seen dozens of times already, and even with the lower price comparison to Netflix it just doesn't seem worth it. I think the only real reason I keep this subscription is just to watch the three new shows that interest me when they come out since almost all of Disney's 2020 movie releases were just bad.

I feel as though I'm paying $8 a month for 3 shows that release weekly for some reason, a bunch of older movies I've already seen, painfully childish cartoons that don't have any subtext in them to entertain anyone over the age of 12, the occasional documentary about nature or something, Jeff Goldblum who is a national treasure, and whatever their Disney+ exclusive movies were supposed to be. If Disney could just hurry up and incorporate all their acquisitions into one streaming platform with one overall cost, then it might actually be worthwhile. Even then, the Mandalorian season finale reveal of a CG mask on a stunt guy instead of just a recasting after the flak Disney got for doing it in a movie was surprising in a bad way. I also recognize that COVID really put the kibosh on their launch plans, but man, is it just painful. 

A good metaphor for Disney+ in my mind is like making a PowerPoint presentation that you think needs to be done by Friday, starting at a reasonable time to finish by Friday, finding out on Tuesday that it needs to be ready by Wednesday, scrambling to finish the presentation, filling the last half of the slideshow with MS Paint drawings, barely coherent points, and a few slides from a different presentation you gave 10 years ago to pad the numbers, and expecting to keep your job after making the presentation.",streaming service opinion scroll bit subreddit look hot new post post read like marketing material instead actual human interaction sure reddit exclusive subreddit ecosystem outside subreddit actual streaming service great ui clunky bad amazon prime low bar review available app movie avoid waste viewer time expectation recommendation property dozen time low price comparison worth think real reason subscription new interest come movie release bad feel pay month release weekly reason bunch old movie painfully childish cartoon subtext entertain age occasional documentary nature jeff goldblum national treasure exclusive movie suppose hurry incorporate acquisition streaming platform overall cost actually worthwhile mandalorian season finale reveal cg mask stunt guy instead recasting flak movie surprising bad way recognize covid kibosh launch plan man painful good metaphor mind like powerpoint presentation think need friday start reasonable time finish friday find tuesday need ready wednesday scramble finish presentation fill half slideshow ms paint drawing barely coherent point slide different presentation year ago pad number expect job presentation,418,0.08831818181818184,positive,1

DisneyPlus,"Disney+ hasn't nailed weekly releases. (Opinion) While I welcome Disney's decision to return to a weekly release schedule for their shows compared to the full release model by competitors, I personally believe it could be improved.

9/10 times I prefer full season drops over weekly releases. Yet, I rarely have the time to watch more than a couple of hours at most per day. And even though I like watching the same show multiple days in a row I think there is something that was lost when weekly releases started to disappear (i.e. speculation, anticipation and discussion, but most importantly: spoiler free watching).

With Disney+ I'm in the dilemma: do I wait until the season is finished to watch it within a week, but run the risk of getting spoiled for close to every major event that occurs during the season, simply by using the internet; or do I watch 20-30 minute bits of the story each week for 2 months.

I think my problem with Disney+ Originals weekly release schedule is, their story develops to slow. These shows move at the speed of a sitcom, but try and convey the action and intricate story lines of interconnected blockbuster movies.

I believe that, even if they want to stretch out a season to cover multiple months (to rack in that monthly subscription), releasing two episodes a week (or the equivalent of close to an hour of content) would potentially improve the pace of the storytelling, which in turn would get more people to watch episodes around release.

\~50 min per episode = 1 per week (with 10+ episodes this could easily be 2 per week)

\~30 min per episode = 2 per week (ideal for 10 episode seasons aka Disney+ Originals?)

\~20 min per episode = 3 per week (especially with an episode count of 20+ per season)

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Weekly episodes should be increased relative to their average runtime and total episode count of a season to improve the pace of the story.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: After reading all the comments (Thank you), I realised I need to explain my point better: I'm not arguing for full releases.

I'm arguing for looking beyond the two options of either 1) a full release or 2) a single episode per week. Especially for shows that tell a continuous narrative throughout the season (Especially if the average runtime of an episode is ≤30 minutes). This could be by releasing 2 episodes a week.

DisneyPlus,"Looking through ""Pixar Through the Years,"" it looks like Pixar went overboard with Cars shorts. And a disturbingly majority are Mater-focused. I'm new to this sub, and not sure if general discussion or analystic posts are generally accepted, but I had some free time today and decided to just browse the Disney+ app, the first time I've really been able to do so since launch day in 2019.

I'm going to put a huge disclaimer right here before I go any further: 

I am not saying that Pixar needs to only work on original media, including movies and shorts. I'm not saying that I don't want them to make sequels, or shorts based on previous Pixar films. I'm also not saying that every Pixar film series needs their own line of shorts. I'm not complaining about anything. This is just a fun and silly ""Holy cow, I didn't realize just how *much* Pixar cashed-in on the Cars brand.""

Here's the main post, and my random weekend discovery:

I know that Cars was huge at release. I didn't have small children in my household from 2006-Now, so I can't speak for Cars' popularity post-the movie's release in 2006, I just remember that in 2006, Cars was *the* kids movie (that adults could also enjoy, of course, all Pixar movies are.)

I was sitting here just flipping through ""Pixar Through the Years"" and from the very beginning with The Adventures of André &amp; Wally B. all the way up to the One Man Band short, every work released, aside from Toy Story 2, a sequel, and Mike's New Car, a short based on the previous Pixar film, Monsters Inc., is an original work.

Once you get to Cars, Lifted, an original short, is next, followed by Mater and the Ghost Light. I'm not going to list every single movie release and every single short release, but from 2006's ""Mater and the Ghostlight,"" and 2014's ""Cars Toon: The Radiator Springs 500 1/2"" (my God, what a name,) there are 32 total shorts, 16 total Cars shorts (12 of which being Mator-Focused) spanning 10 years. Out of these 32 total shorts, half of these are Cars shorts.

Cars shorts aren't the only ones that were made over those 10 years. Again, I won't list them all, but every movie post-Cars except The Good Dinosaur, Coco, Onward, and Soul recieved shorts in their series. Toy Story 4 is also getting up there to compete with Cars, with 11 shorts, all but one focusing on Forky.

This isn't how I imagined I'd spend one of my days off, but thanks to Disney by incorporating a ""By Release Date"" tab, I learned a lot from Pixar's history, including just how much they love Mater and Forky. I guess if I spent more time watching the Pixar movies I haven't seen rather than focusing so much on how many Cars shorts there are, I'd have more productive days.

I hope you all get as much of a laugh out of this as I did, I've typed and said ""short"" so much that I don't even remember what it means. Stay safe out there, and I hope everyone has a great weekend.",look pixar years look like pixar overboard car short disturbingly majority mater focus new sub sure general discussion analystic post generally accept free time today decide browse app time able launch day huge disclaimer right far pixar need work original medium include movie short want sequel short base previous pixar film pixar film series need line short complain fun silly holy cow realize pixar cash cars brand main post random weekend discovery know cars huge release small child household speak cars popularity post movie release remember cars kid movie adult enjoy course pixar movie sit flip pixar year beginning adventures andré amp wally way man band short work release aside toy story sequel mike new car short base previous pixar film monsters original work cars lifted original short follow mater ghost light list single movie release single short release mater ghostlight car toon radiator springs god total short total cars short mator focused span year total short half cars short car short year wo list movie post car good dinosaur coco onward soul recieve short series toy story compete cars short focus forky imagine spend day thank incorporate release date tab learn lot pixar history include love mater forky guess spend time pixar movie focus car short productive day hope laugh type short remember mean stay safe hope great weekend,533,0.14092961636065088,positive,1

DisneyPlus,"Since a lot of people have been asking the difference between Disney+, Star and Disney+ Hotstar, here's a definite explanation. (I wrote this as a reply to a comment but I'm making a post since I see the same question being posted a 100 times each day.) Star TV was founded in 1990 in Asia by a few companies not important to the story but then Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation (through 21st Century Fox) bought all of Star TV by 1993. They started a subsidiary in India called 'Star India' which later became the parent company absorbing all the business under it.

In 2015, Star India started its own streaming service for sports and general entertainment called *Hotstar* with content from India and all over the world including shows from labels like HBO and Showtime under exclusive licensing deals. 

They acquired exclusive streaming rights for the Indian Premier League (Cricket tournament) in 2015 which actually made Hotstar a big deal in India along with the fact that it was the exclusive home of Game of Thrones. 

In 2019, Disney acquired 21st Century Fox, in the process it also acquired Star India which later became a subsidiary of The Walt Disney Company India. 

In late 2019 Disney+ was launched but they didn't want to create unnecessary competition for themselves in the Indian market since Hotstar already existed and they owned it. So they rebranded the service to *Disney+ Hotstar* and made it the official home of Disney content in India. Disney+ Hotstar was also expanded to Indonesia minus the third party content from the likes of HBO and Showtime.

DisneyPlus,"New Disney+ Bundle with Ad-Free Hulu and Verizon Offer Hey folks,

I'm new to the community here. 
I read that Disney is now making the Disney+ Bundle were ad-free Hulu available to everyone as an option. 

I currently have the Disney+ bundle from Verizon and pay $6 month to have ad-free Hulu (I believe I had to sign up ad-free Hulu before signing up for the Verizon Offer). 

I'm wondering if anyone knows if it's possible to sign up for the new bundle with ad-free Hulu and then combine it with the Verizon Offer? And whether that'd save me any money? I did reach out to Disney+ support but they told me that I can't combine the two.

iTunes are constantly updating classic films to their 4K re-release.

DisneyPlus,"Continue Watching feature doesn't work at all. Hey everyone,


I'm watching Disney+ on my laptop (Chrome) and it almost always deletes my progress for movies or series instead of creating a ""continue watching"" list. Which is quite annoying because I have to find out which episode I left off at every time or skim through an unfinished movie to find the last scene I remember. Often, it doesn't even register my progress immediately after leaving the title. I realise it isn't anything major but it is annoying and I think we should be able to expect this feature to work properly, right?


Does anybody encounter similar problems or know a possible solution? Thanks in advance for any advice.

.

specifics:

**Device:** Asus Zenbook, Windows 10, using Chrome (latest version, 88.0.4324.104)

**Service:** Disney+

**Country:** Germany

**Steps taken:** I eliminated some suggested causes: I'm not being logged off every time I close the window, I cleared my cache &amp; cookies, all cookies are allowed and obviously tried restarting everything repeatedly. I have tried it on my PS4 but that didn't help either.

Any ideas? I've googled for a bit but couldn't find another solution. It seems it isn't a frequent problem. All I find are articles that Disney+ didn't roll out with the feature. No shit Sherlock.

.

Edit: I found a **solution**!
Essentially, my cookie preferences obstructed the feature. I had enabled a browser extension and further settings that helped me allow only essential cookies.

DisneyPlus,"Disney-owned content still on HBO / Cinemax / HBO Max (with exit dates!)  A sequel to my recent Starz post - [Disney-owned titles Still on Starz (with exit dates)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DisneyPlus/comments/l367rb/disneyowned_content_still_on_starz_with_exit_dates/)

Thanks to the magic of my cable company listing HBO / Cinemax expiration dates and the time I spent going through the Disney / Fox library, I can now share the complete list of Disney / Fox titles on Starz along with their exit date. However, keep in mind when titles leave HBO they often go over to Cinemax, or vice versa. And there are often times when the films complete their stay in WarnerMedia's land that they still go off to Hulu or Prime Video instead of coming right to Disney+.

HBO is a LOT worse than Starz with double the titles left and new titles continuing to come each month. Fox really left Disney a mess with their contracts...

**BOLD** titles means they have been on Disney+ before (and thus will return when able) or are on Disney+ in other countries and thus more likely to be added. I also include the RATED R films in the list just for fun even though in America those films will all go to Hulu.

  The following leave January 31st – **Bridge to Terabithia,** Planet of the Apes (2001), Walk the Line, Enemy of the State (RATED R), Martha Marcy May Marlene (RATED R)

**Note:** Mr Popper’s Penguins was supposed to come to Disney+ January 1st and no-showed. It is still on HBO but does not have an expiration date. I expect it to leave February 28 as that will mark 15 months which is usually how long Fox films stay.

**Note 2:** The first 10 films listed are not their HBO expiration date, but rather their Disney+ arrival date. Anything beyond these 9 is NOT confirmed for the year and likely to go to Prime Video or Hulu before Disney+

DisneyPlus,"Stuttering on NVIDIA Shield TV Hi,

I'm experiencing this odd issue with Disney+ on my Shield TV... When streaming a movie/tv show, I experience stuttering 5/6 times per minutes(stuttering, not buffering)... It only last a couple of seconds, but it throws me off the immersion.
That's really odd because I don't experience it on my TV (55OLED804) but as the app doesn't have HDR support on this TV (oddly, it was there before) I use the Shield

At first I thought it was some TV processing issue, but as it turns out, I disabled everything and the issue remains the same

Out of Disney+ I can watch HDR media on Netflix/Kodi/Prime Video without any issues, both on TV directly and on Shield (even Dolby Vision on Netflix from the TV directly)

The Shield is a very capable device, how come it stutters like that?

Service: Disney+ app on Roku and Fire Cube with Verizon FiOS 1GB internet.

Country: US

Issue: Disney+ app on Roku Ultra or Fire Cube won't stream in 4k Ultra HD.  When looking at a movie such as 'Soul' it shows ""HD"" not ""4K Ultra HD"".  However the Prime and Netflix apps do stream 4K Ultra HD on both Roku and Fire.

Steps Taken: Chatted with Disney+ support.  They said to delete and resinstall app.  Made no difference.  Since 4K will stream on Prime and Netflix the issue is not cables, HDCP 2.2, or bandwidth.

Observations: Disney+ app decides on its own what quality to stream.  It's deciding for me that 4K Ultra HD cannot be streamed even though other apps do stream 4K Ultra HD.  My TV is not HDR but when looking at the ""Details"" tab of various 4K content on Disney+ it usually says it has Ultra HD as well as HDR versions.

netflix,"Marriage or Mortgage I personally really enjoy this show. Each episode there are 2 people who are engaged, wanting to have a big perfect dream wedding. They also want to have a house, either to settle in, for work or to get more space. They only have the funds for either a House Mortgage or a Wedding. The Wedding Planner will compete with the Realtor to help the couple to choose a wedding and the Realtor tries to get the couple to purchase a home. There are great episodes where you would want them to either choose a wedding or a home and their choosing can make you feel like your on a game show trying to win the prize but its for a couple deciding to get a wedding of their dreams or a house of their dreams.",marriage mortgage personally enjoy episode people engaged want big perfect dream wedding want house settle work space fund house mortgage wedding wedding planner compete realtor help couple choose wedding realtor try couple purchase home great episode want choose wedding home choosing feel like game try win prize couple decide wedding dream house dream,139,0.3333333333333333,positive,0
netflix,"How does Netflix promote things to you? Do we all have a different home page? I think Netflix thinks i/we are lesbians. So heres what we do.. we open up the netflix app on PS4

usually we look at the top 10 trending row.   We don't really bother scrolling through all the endless categories and rows.  Basically just whats top trending or recommended front and center.   We never rate the things we watch.

netflix,"Review of ""The One"" Ep. 2 [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/m7ex7n/review_of_the_one/) is my first review of the show if you are curious. Contains minor Spoilers for Netflix's original show, ""**The One**."" You have been warned :)

So, I just finished watching the second episode, and it hasn't gotten any better. First I want to discuss Hannah. So her whole story in this episode is that she goes behind her husbands (?) back and finds what his match is, meets up with the girl, and tries to get to know her and avoid them from meeting. My issues with this is, who in their right mind would ever do this? She seemed so normal and confident in the relationship at first, but her character just flipped around!! Not only does she snoop around the girls flat; which was just such an uncomfortable scene, she is lying to her husband!! Which if he finds out, she will just ruin her own marriage! I get being insecure, but her friend told her what she was doing was insane, but she just ignored it. how ignorant can one be?

Secondly, all of the characters. They are just so rude and annoying, and not relatable at all. While yes, characters do not have to be relatable to be good, its better than being annoying insufferable jerks! And I am not in my 20's-30's like they seem to be, but what's with all the talk about sex 24/7?? It's just uncomfortable and unnecessary. They just seem to throw it in whenever they don't know what to add.  

I really want to focus on Rebecca, too. I have no idea what they are going for with her character, is it sympathy, anger, hatred? what do they want me to feel? Normally show directors have a certain emotion they want to spark when they see a character, but I just feel nothing. I have no passion or interest in anybody in this damned show! They all just do things and whine about the consequences of their stupid actions!

Another thing that bothered me a ton, is the length. I am 100% biased with shows who have 45 minute long episodes. Personally, 20-30 minutes is a much better length. of course, shows which have good and actually thought provoking content can get away with it, but with just utter trash like this, it goes on for way too long! Half of the scenes don't even need to be there to tell the story either, there's so much filler that tells us nothing. 

My family i am watching it with says ""its so good!"" ""It's like Black Mirror"" which makes me want to puke! No offense to them, they can enjoy what they want, But never compare this to the actually acceptable good show Black Mirror. And I tell them most of my criticism, but they just shove it off with 'well I don't think that.' which can be frustrating. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt, I definitely watch way too many Film analysis'/reviews on YouTube, so my sense of if a film is good or not (in my opinion) is probably a bit better than others.

So, in summary. Show is not getting better at all. The characters suck, I feel no emotion while watching it, and the runtime is awful. Feel free to share thoughts!

netflix,"Tips on the future setup Hi,

I have a question regarding my RTV setup, it's highly connected to netlfix so I decided to post it here hoping for an answer.

So far I've been using a PS4 as way of transmitting my Netflix/Spotify signal onto an amplifier which then sent the signal to the TV. Basically my medias are connected to amplifier via HDMI and then signal is sent onto the 5.0 surround system while image is sent to the TV.

Well, when PS5 was announced I sold my og PS4 hoping to sell it before it highly drops in value. Annnnd as of now I have no source for the netflix to play of. I've been using my laptop to do that, it works but carrying it around with a charger is a pain in the ass.

I've been thinking maybe about buying a smart TV since my TV, although it works is an old 1080 32"". And I could gift it to my grandmother who is using an even older TV after getting a new one. Well but what about the signal then? With my current amplifier setup I can make it so that sound goes from TV to amplifier. But what about me wanting to play something in case I do buy a PS5 soon (once it's available). Shouldn't I opt out for a cheaper non smart TV? Then I also saw pieces of hardware which act as a smart TV and are really cheap.",tip future setup hi question regard rtv setup highly connected netlfix decide post hope answer far use way transmit spotify signal amplifier send signal tv basically media connect amplifier hdmi signal send surround system image send tv announce sell og hope sell highly drop value annnnd source play use laptop work carry charger pain ass think maybe buy smart tv tv work old gift grandmother use old tv new signal current amplifier setup sound tv amplifier want play case buy soon available opt cheap non smart tv piece hardware act smart tv cheap,248,0.19042053184910326,positive,0

netflix,"Why are Netflix movies so shit? Seriously 90% of the movies on Netflix are straight garbage and the other 10% are either films that literally everyone in the world has watched or few Netflix movies that are actually good such as Roma and uncut gems. It’s just crazy how much money they make and how bad the content is.

The series on the other hand are a lot better and most of the Netflix original series are watchable. 

We’ve reached the point that a movie like mank (a mediocre movie at best in my opinion and one of the most forgettable Fincher movies) gets 10 Oscar nominations and everyone’s talking about it as if it’s The Godfather or Casablanca or sth. 

TLDR: the quality of Netflix movies is really low and people don’t seem to care or mind watching garbage content

That’s just my opinion but if you check the Netflix movies ratings on IMDb you’ll see most of them are 4s or 5s. 

It’s just frustrating that the most popular and richest streaming service provides such low content to its customers and they except us not to care, and the funny thing is no one seems to care.",movie shit seriously movie straight garbage film literally world movie actually good roma uncut gem crazy money bad content series hand lot original series watchable reach point movie like mank mediocre movie good opinion forgettable fincher movie oscar nomination talk godfather casablanca sth tldr quality movie low people care mind garbage content opinion check movie rating imdb frustrating popular rich streaming service provide low content customer care funny thing care,199,0.06080246913580248,positive,0

B: The Beginning is a thriller with plenty of twists and turns in its story to keep you interested. It’s not really a traditional mystery because (like Death Note) the titular ‘Killer B’ that the title alludes to is revealed in the first episode and is one of our two protagonists.

One being the enigmatic Koku with his black wings and nack for murdering criminals, he is the classic lead character a teenager that struggles to maintain relevance until his backstory is fleshed out during the second half of the season. ´ He’s just an angsty teenager with black-wings and an arm that turns into a sword… that mai have a interesting backstory that might be unknown .

netflix,"Review of ""The One"" I am only on Episode One, but good god did this show irk my nerves. Please keep in mind i am no professional and this is just one annoyed viewers opinion. Spoilers too!!!! &lt;---

It was just.. terrible! Not only did they introduce like 100 characters in one go, i barely remember what they looked like! and they all had generic names, rebecca, james, ben, marc, meghan, kate... and it goes on and on! they all look almost exactly the same too. i know almost nothing about each of them besides rebecca owns the big company and possibly killed someone. And the pacing was god awful, there are so many unnecessary and drawn out scenes... like did we really need the scene where that one blonde girl, i think her name was kate, was in the grocery store and explained to her friend her new partner? and the sex scene between the black couple? not only was it uncomfortable, it added almost nothing.

and  the body that was found in the river. it looks horribly unrealistic considering it was a year old.. it would not be that in tact if the water was rushing to it for a year! im not even an expert and know that well! and i might have a biased opinion because netflix originals never get my hopes up, but seriously how do you mess up this badly? the idea is like something from a YA book for teenagers, its not interesting at all. plus my family i was watching with basically predicted everything that happened before it did!   


plus its so.. unrealistic!! like no sane person would talk like they do, it sounds like the writers trying to be so millennial-like but hip at the same time. its just.. eugh.. makes me cringe thinking about it. a good example of this would be the speech at the beginning, imagine you are the leader of a massive company and you script your big presentation as if you were talking in a comedy routine!! its so just horrible to watch! and the paparazzi people as they come out, why is there only like 5 of them? did netflix have that bad of a budget for this film they couldnt add more?  its probably picky but seriously, do only like 5 news sources care about this apparently famous, popular app developer? it doesn't seem to be that way??

It's a fantastic, surprising mature young adult book series set in the 90's, and it's only ever had one adaption (a live action one that quit production part-way through due to mediocre reviews and the cost of live animal training. The reviews, I assure you, are not a reflection on the quality of the source material, which is excellent.)

I think it would make the transition to animation quite well, and the frantic, life or death battles between animals and aliens would truly be something to behold.

(As an aside, there could even be Beast Wars figures included as product placement somewhere, as they were on store shelves at the time and, fun fact, the characters were actually seen playing the Beast Wars video game in the live action adaption AND Hasbro released a line of Animorph transformers around the same time, so there's a good deal of crossover. Since Hasbro has been releasing some new Beast Wars figures recently to coincide with Netflix's own ""Transformers: Kingdom"" series, seems like a good time to do it.)

Random examples besides Open House, I recently also saw A  Nightmares Wakes, A  Curse For Wellness, and They Look Like People.  Obviously lots of things *happen*, but a lot of it goes by quickly and it all feels inconsequential and  random in the end and maintains a steady headache-inducing mundane tone  without any real payoff. It's kind of more of a lite drama with a   ghost/shadowy figure thrown in or something.

I  don't  think it has to do with being a slow-burner genre, I can love those, The Shining is slow burner that maintains a real sense of atmosphere and dread that entices you to keep  watching until hell breaks loose or the twist is unveiled. Rosemary's Baby is one of my favorite horror films ever.

In the sort of movies I mentioned earlier something very fucked up and  interesting can happen for a change, and then the scene just switches. Normally something so fucked up would mean the movie is escalating, at least psychologically, and previous ""mundane"" events are making sense,  right? Nope, there's still  another hour of exposition scenes and strange pseudo-ominous character drama (including introspective as well as between characters). I  enjoy how recent horror has moved from cheap  jump scares loud sound effects and more into atmosphere, but this is  something I don't think  anybody really asked for.

These types of ""horror movies"" ""thrillers"" I have seen in recent years will  literally focus on the process of a character unwrapping a TV dinner and  putting it into the microwave for 10 minutes, or chopping up fruit to  put into a blender while the character looks very concerned.

I think horror has somewhat lost it's focus and has gotten to be just.....boring.

netflix,"(SPOILERS) Behind Her Eyes was disappointing— excuse this unpopular opinion if you’re a fan It starts off like an alright thriller, I thoroughly enjoyed Simona Brown’s (Louise) acting. The complicated relationships were intriguing. But as the plot went on it got shittier.

This woman is given a 30 page journal about some seriously wild things, and it takes her DAYS (weeks?) to read it. That’s so unrealistic, given how intrigued she is.

Both the husband and the wife knew where Louise lived and never crossed paths somehow while visiting her? Mind you, they show up unannounced all the time. (Maybe the wife had an advantage over the husband on this, but still.)

I find it so hard to believe that a psychiatrist (in this rehab-y situation) would not wait to check if their patient (Adele) have swallowed their medication, knowing how defiant they were to the whole situation.

Also in the end, why not leave Adam with his father? Yes, the “boat” dialogue was like a “wink wink” to the audience, but other than that there isn’t a logical reason why Rob would want to have him around— on their honeymoon LOL!

I felt like the twists were pretty clear from early on. The camera tricks of showing an incident from above often means someone else is watching. Murder as the reason why this couple stays together was pretty clear too— before Rob’s introduction, I thought it would be the parents. (Also, does that have an explanation in the book? I just can’t believe they didn’t resolve that in the series.) And just.. astral projection. My god. What a lazy explanation for “knowing everything”.

netflix,"Just watched Finding Ohana. It was a fun movie. I loved it so much. Especially the cheesy parts. 

But I am distressed by the obvious lack of Israel Kamakawiwo’ole. Considering the message of the movie and considering his talent and his life and the lore that surrounds the people born, that are like him. 

The movie was otherwise perfect. The sound track was absolute shit. All regurgitated Hollywood bullishit, pop style. There were like two tracks total that actually utilized Hawaiian style music and not one of them were actually locally sourced. 

But images of Keanu were everywhere and recognized. 

I’m not Hawaiian. But I’m also not ignorant to tradition and culture. Finding Ohana could have been a cultural blockbuster. Instead we got generic pop music and forced Goonies style antics. 

The only thing that saves this movie? The actors and actresses and the few and far between actual cultural references. The best scenes are the scenes depicting legit Hawaiian belief and the struggles they faced as a result of colonization. 

Don’t get me wrong. It’s an excellent movie and it’s great for family movie night. It’s got everything. 

I just wish it wasn’t White washed to appease the general public. 

The woman that physically raised me? Hapu. She identified as female. Came to the mainland states in the 60s because she thought it would be better here. Smartest most talented human I’ve ever known. And the US ruined her and she got stuck here and she was never able to go back home.

She died here near to forgotten. Because Ohana (home) and what comes with that doesn’t exist here. It should, because we are all neighbors, but people.

I’d give anything to have that kind of connection with other people. I had it with her. I try to connect with others the same way. But people are people and we are selfish creatures. 

Heart breaking.

Anyway. I highly recommend the film. It’s a great adventure and the Actors and actresses did a phenomenal job. I just wish more Hawaiian musicians would have been highlighted in the film and I wish there was no need to have this kind of conversation.

netflix,"Netflix crackdown on password sharing opinion. It is so weird for me to say this but I myself  have Netflix and I don't really use it. And I find the fact that they're now choosing to crack down on password sharing to be probably an opportunity for people to just cancel the service. For me, a lot of shows have been lost from Netflix and I'm having to move to other streaming services to pick those up. And paying for different streaming services I feel more fluid with my money. So for me to suspend the account or cancel the accounts, is becoming the normal. So I think Netflix doing this will probably hurt them in the end. I just added Paramount Plus to my lists.

It just becomes ew and obsessive at some point. Case in point: RIVERDALE ( i think its nflx, not sure), Ginny&amp; Georgia, To all the boys..., Never Have I ever, and Kissing Booth 1/2. In this day and age it's definitely amazing to be sex positive, but 99% of ppl in HS are laid back and just go about their day, these shows hypersexualize teens in a horrible manner. The writing of teen nflx characters is so edgy and intense as if they've never met teens nowadays. It just comes off as super fucking creepy, and especially the way they go about it too.

netflix,"I have a series pitch that could be Netflix's own Star Wars. What Do I do? In late 2013, I and a friend came up with a story idea, that story idea then became a 2 hour long summary of a timeline involving multiple characters across a continuous story spanning over 500 years. I've been writing this even after the friend abandoned it in 2015. I continued the work, making characters, making concept art, writing dialogue, perfecting structure, story events and lore. What started off as a simple, ""hey let's make a web show"" turned into me devoting the past 8 years writing this on and off. I've filled my 4th book of brainstorms and drafts and I think it's about time it actually gets out there instead of eventually dying with me.

I won't say too much about the plot or what the series is about but I can say, just imagine Game of Thrones meeting Star Wars. There's enough tear-jerkers, WTF moments, plot twists and Holy Shit moments to go around to keep people eyes fixed.

Take me from a few years ago, I had no faith in the project. But with my time in college studying film, animation and concept art to be able to work on this project once greenlit coming to an end, I feel that it needs to get out there before something similar comes along and I can kiss any dreams of it coming on my mother's TV goodbye.

The thing is, I have the pitch but I have no idea the process of pitching. I don't know any agents affiliated with Netflix or any streaming platform, nor do i know how to find one. Netflix doesn't accept unsolicited pitches, so I'm looking for a start here with this creative journey.

netflix,"Netflix looks terrible in browsers but not ipad?  Putting a description of banding at the bottom of the post in case anyone's unsure of what that is.

I have a 32 inch monitor connected to my imac and my pc, I also have an Asus TUF gaming monitor connected to both. In any case, viewing on any computer monitor (including the imac's lovely built-in screen), dark scenes on netflix look like an awful low-res mess. The colour depth is not great, but the banding is just insane. I've only started thinking about it so hard because if I get into bed and keep watching on my ipad the jump in picture quality is huge, the resolution appears much crsiper, the image looks softer and nicer, and the banding situation is just totally different, there is SO much less of it, perhaps none at all. The difference is so profound that it leads me to assume I am watching a differently encoded file when viewing on my ipad. I watch loads of netflix on my monitor though as I often have it on whilst I work. I understand the ipad is displaying the video at a lower resolution but is that really the beginning and end of the explanation?

Really wish I could watch browser-netflix to a ""TV standard"", just as I can watch a movie in the living room and it look's great. I assume there is no 'fix' for this but I'm just reaching out to see if there is anything at all I can do about it. Definitely feels like I'm not getting my money's worth by consuming dozens of hours of content that is of the same visual standard of those janky watch-tv-online type sites that were prominent 10 or so years ago.

""The ""blocky"" banding is due to compression on the stream where all the various shadings of black/gray that were there were compressed down to a single solid color in the block to save on the bandwidth (since now it just sends the one color for that entire block instead of needing to send the color for each of the pixels within the block).""",look terrible browser ipad description banding post case unsure inch monitor connect imac pc asus tuf gaming monitor connect case view computer monitor include imac lovely build screen dark scene look like awful low res mess colour depth great banding insane start think hard bed ipad jump picture quality huge resolution appear crsiper image look soft nice banding situation totally different difference profound lead assume differently encode file view ipad load monitor whilst work understand ipad display video low resolution beginning end explanation wish browser tv standard movie living room look great assume fix reach definitely feel like money worth consume dozen hour content visual standard janky tv online type site prominent year ago blocky banding compression stream shading black gray compress single solid color block save bandwidth send color entire block instead need send color pixel block,359,-0.04361239119303633,negative,0
netflix,"Just Watched ""I Care A Lot"" and Cringed So Hard I Almost Threw up \*SPOILER ALERT\*

I get the argument that movies don't have to be realistic ""cause they're just movies"", but ""I care a lot"" is worse than the Disney Starwars Movies. Here are some of what I thought were some honorable mentions:

* In court, people are just shouting and screaming as they wish. No expert here, but aren't only the lawyers allowed to speak?
* Why didn't the fashionable purple tie lawyer ask to get a second doctor to review the old lady? The judge would for sure say yes, and the second doctor would see that the old lady is pumped way too high with drugs.
* Why did the leader of the Russian mafia send only 3 people in to get his mother from the nursing home? He could easily have done 5-6
* Why did the security guard just start firing his weapon at first sight of the mobsters? He didn't even know they were mobsters? Not even Chicago Police officers take out their guns that quickly
* Why did the main character and her girlfriend go immediately when they heard that the nursing home was being attacked, why not call the police?  

   * Let's say that they both managed to kill the blonde mobster on the way out of the nursing home with a baseball bat while he had a gun because of feminism, why didn't the Russian Mob boss send out a couple of guys to rescue his mother when she's right there in his sight? Since the gangsters literally only have to kill two people without guns to complete the mission.
* When Peter Dinklage gave the okay to murder her, I'm sure the producers did this on purpose, but how are we supposed to think she survived when she got her lungs pumped with liquid and was in a devastating car crash
* Then how are we supposed to believe that the mob decided to just leave her dark-haired girlfriend alive when they know that if you leave people alive they can call the police and generate evidence to have them arrested?
* .
* .
* The last point I would like to make is that the last quote towards the end of the movie by Peter Dinklage ""Or you could become my partner"" is the part where I almost threw up. A real Russian mob boss would have given her the money and killed her on the spot

I honestly didn't mean to make this post offensive, I apologize in advance if I hurt anyone's feelings. I am glad that there is more female representation in action-thriller movies, although, there is no need to explicitly state your themes of feminism in the writing of the movie. Even though the movie is obviously created to be ""progressive,"" it seems that a lot of the women in it are type-casted, like ""the tall confident lesbian that doesn't take shit from no man"" I feel is kind of a stereotype for lesbian women. I bet the producers are thinking "" there's no way a straight woman could be so ruthless and powerful we have to make her lesbian."" I also am upset by this epidemic of less than mediocre movie writing and plots being covered up with exceptional production quality and videography.

netflix,"Subtitles rights? Not sure this is a tech support question or a rant or neither but as a Swiss-American who has recently moved back to Switzerland from the US, I had a question on subtitles. 

I am admittedly accustomed to the subtitle options in the US that seem to include whatever is available (i.e. usually everything from Spanish to English to French to German to Chinese etc). 

Now coming to Switzerland, it seems a lot of shows and movies, even Netflix Originals or content that I know from the US has other language subtitles, will only have German subtitles or only French subtitles or only Italian subtitles. Not even for content in English audio will have English subtitles, and I think equally frustrating is sometimes it's even French content with only German subtitles or the inverse. 

Which seems like an odd choice to exclude what I presume to be a pretty simple inclusion of other languages for subtitles. So is this somehow an issue where the rights for subtitles somehow cost more and thus they keep it at the bare minimum?

While I do have a netflix account, it's on a very specific email address and as far as I know i've never put my other email accounts into any netflix profile or anything, ESPECIALLY my work email, which is on the company domain.

So a couple weeks ago when I got an email in my company email saying ""Thanks for setting up your netflix account!"" I dismissed it as phishing. Didn't even open it. Today I got another on one of my personal email accounts. This time I looked deeper into it. It's not Phishing. It actually comes from the [netflix.com](https://netflix.com) domain, all the links in the email ACTUALLY link to [netflix.com](https://netflix.com) pages, and even the unsubscribe and ""contact us"" links go to actual [netflix.com](https://netflix.com) pages.

So I went back into the company email spam folder, checked it. It's a legit email too. Everything in the email comes from and goes to [netflix.com](https://netflix.com) pages.

Should I be contacting netflix and making sure there aren't netflix accounts being set up with my personal and work email accounts? My best bet is that some affiliate is setting up ""free 1 month trial"" accounts without authorization and getting a kickback for it.

Edit: I talked to netflix. This is indeed an affiliate scam. An affiliate uses your email account to start the process, you get the email. If within X days you actually use that email to get a legit account, they get paid.

If you get this type of email, call netflix and let them know.

Stranger Things (if you want to make a dark story, then dont do it with kids as the heroes. if you do that, then at least make their characters extremely strong-headed and mature. normally, movies with stereotypical ""unpopular kids"" as main characters are happy or comedy so its fine doing that but not in a show that you intend to make a dark one. also, why must you throw in romance in a show with kids as the main characters.)

Breaking Bad (the premise and everything is great. the story is great. its just way too stretched out. i havent seen it fully as it stretched the story of a dying person to 4 seasons and ended with him dying not even by cancer which was the start of the whole thing. this is better than the rest but too stretched out.)

Money Heist (entire season passed and they are still in the same bank)

&amp;#x200B;

I did actually like the movie and thought a lot of things were well done but while some aspects were impressive the same old tired stereotypes and one dimensional characters left a bad taste in my mouth.

&amp;#x200B;

1) Asian best friend who has strict parents, her mum doesn't speak English and then there was the line about how you couldn't understand what her mum had to do to get to America.

Am sure that is still true for some but this feels like a racial stereotype in 2021.

&amp;#x200B;

2) The white privilege personified in the arch-villain jock.

American teen movies love the nerds and jocks as much as they love the doe-eyed cheerleaders but it would have been better to see more than just a one dimensional trope for this guy. 

&amp;#x200B;

3) His black sidekick/best friend.

Talk about one dimensional, this character was only used for animalistic over the top gestures or expressions. Think of an unloveable Donkey from Shrek but with zero dialogue and added sexual predator vibes.

Acting is good, not amazing though. The whole vibe is nice, scenery looks great and it can get tense and scare you with its gunshots. The couple act normally at best, sometimes they do end up doing weird things but mainly because theyre afraid of dying. The first 20 minutes of the movie make it seem like its a basic revenge movie but you have that feeling that the ""poeple"" wouldnt just kill the couple for scratching their car. When the red dot glides over them to scare them you already know they are gonna torture them. Right at the begining you see the ending but it honestly doesnt destroy the vibe too much as it does give a little hope but its not the best choice, although it is because you already know everythings gonna go downwards. The twist is great, everything adds up and you realise its not just because of a couple keying a car. The emotions of thomas are well shown and actually realistic, thomas has been waiting so long just to get revenge as that kid was everything to him. True, its irresponsible that he flew a drone so far away but at least its better than just saying that there was no drone, it shows the importance of the kid to the father.

I think there are some people who would agree there is a simple explanation for what happened to her, but the amateur ""sleuths"" and ""internet detectives"" have forever dragged this poor girls' name through the mud, stained her reputation and the worst part is that Netflix gave them a platform to do so.

The interviewee crew all lack any sort of credibility on providing an expert opinion - we have countless YouTubers perspectives who are trying to perpetuate an alternative theory that will drive up their view counts, an internet dork who cries and obsesses over Elisa like he knows her personally and has suffered a huge loss - it just undermines what her poor family is going through and now this series will ensure they never move on from this endless tirade of shitty conspiracy theories.

The LAPD releasing that elevator footage is one of the worst mistakes they could've made in this case.

The entire reason being is that the footage is super ambiguous. When you rely on the same perspective to determine what she was doing in that elevator and how she was behaving, you unknowingly have just set a dangerous precedent for anyone who watches that footage.

There is a great theory that Elisa was playfully clicking all of the elevator buttons whilst on the 14th floor (perhaps after having a casual look around) and out of curiosity, slid her finger across a row of levels in the centre column and hit the door hold button.

She could've been confused, possibly a little flustered because she's on the 14th floor and the doors aren't closing. It has a reputation for being dodgy as the floors go up and maybe that's why she's hiding in the corner of the elevator.

She is also a vulnerable, depressed, bipolar woman who is hours away from her immediate support network and that might have exacerbated her condition.

There is a whole spiel that could paint a picture of her journey but we won't go into that.

Instead, the consensus focuses on her experimenting with recreational drugs, scared of someone/someone is with her in the lobby of the elevator, she was put in that tank by an unknown source, the LAPD is hiding the toxicology report because they are involved, a hotel worker is involved and might've coerced her to the roof, it's haunted and she was possessed to commit suicide, +100 more baseless theories.

Not to mention that a death metal musician, who yes, admittedly, posted some creepy shit, was being implicated as a ""murderer"" because of loosely-strung lyrics and music clips. He ultimately also tried to kill himself and was checked into a psychiatric hospital as a result.

I'm just disappointed that the last thing this case needed was another over-saturated, one-sided series that poses no credible sources or multiple points of view and Netflix gave this case a world-wide platform to do just that.

All this series did was ensure that Elisa's family will never be able to move on from this.

EDIT: I should clarify this post focuses on the sleuths and the conspiracy-pushing narrative the documentary had for a good portion of the series. The eventual 20 minutes or so comes to the conclusion that she died in accidental circumstances, but giving this platform to sleuths without knowing the facts and letting them run with it was never a smart move.",elisa lam series appalling suppose expect series talk completely sided narrative rely wishful speculation evident series design pique curiosity spin narrative engage viewer understand appalling think people agree simple explanation happen amateur sleuth internet detective forever drag poor girl mud stain reputation bad platform interviewee crew lack sort credibility provide expert opinion countless youtubers perspective try perpetuate alternative theory drive view count internet dork cry obsesse elisa like know personally suffer huge loss undermine poor family series ensure endless tirade shitty conspiracy theory lapd release elevator footage bad mistake case entire reason footage super ambiguous rely perspective determine elevator behave unknowingly set dangerous precedent footage great theory elisa playfully click elevator button whilst floor casual look curiosity slide finger row level centre column hit door hold button confuse possibly little flustered floor door close reputation dodgy floor maybe hide corner elevator vulnerable depressed bipolar woman hour away immediate support network exacerbate condition spiel paint picture journey wo instead consensus focus experiment recreational drug scare lobby elevator tank unknown source lapd hide toxicology report involve hotel worker involve coerce roof haunt possess commit suicide baseless theory mention death metal musician yes admittedly post creepy shit implicate murderer loosely string lyric music clip ultimately try kill check psychiatric hospital result disappointed thing case need saturate sided series pose credible source multiple point view case world wide platform series ensure elisa family able edit clarify post focus sleuth conspiracy push narrative documentary good portion series eventual minute come conclusion die accidental circumstance platform sleuth know fact let run smart,638,-0.10657665505226478,negative,0

netflix,"Defending The Vanishing at the Cecil Hotel Welp, I'm prepared to receive a huge amount of reasons I'm wrong so here it goes...

(Spoilers Below)

Edit: I don't know why but my numbering isn't working properly while using RIF on my android. But consider them as 1, 2, and 3.



The Vanishing at the Cecil Hotel is flawed. It's far too long, repetitive, and the production overall is not that great. 

However, I would like to address the point of the series because imo it seems to have been misunderstood by many viewers on here. I'll start with this:

1. The series isn't actually about the Elisa Lam case.

While the series involves the case, it uses it as a vehicle to tell a different story of internet investigators. It is a cautionary tale and it is absolutely crucial that the internet sleuths got the screen time that they did. Many people might say that it's disgusting or repulsive or whatever that they were given this much attention. You can decide that yourself, but the attention was negative imo. Throughout the series they are clearly mocked, though in the beginning it appears as though they might be onto something which leads me to my next point...

2. Information is withheld from the viewer (us) on purpose and the reason for this would be lost if it followed the more traditional documentary style of telling all the facts in order.

Many people were angry that the info about the water tank lid being open wasn't completely addressed near the beginning when it was first discussed. While I, and many others, thought it was silly since the maintenance worker clearly had to have opened it at the least himself, it was good that they didn't tell us this one bit of info. This allowed for the conspiracy theorists to present multiple arguments that strayed further and further away from the case. Many saw this as straying further and further from the point of the series, but like I said before the case isn't the point of the series. By doing this it allowed the viewer to become more and more confused, possibly choose a theory that sounds plausible to them, or simply deny it all and agree with the facts provided from the police. This allowed for a recreation of the feeling when the case was still active where you are overwhelmed with information, like one of the officers explained. Being overwhelmed with so much information makes a fairly simple case like this seem much larger. It allows the viewer to become like the conspiracy theorists or deny it, but either way it produces anger. This anger is necessary which leads me to my final point...

3. You should feel angry at the end of the series. This is a true crime series where the viewer becomes an accomplice to the true criminals, the internet sleuths.

This is the most interesting part for me and is what makes me the most sad because it seems like many people aren't understanding it. I will reiterate that the series is deeply flawed but this aspect was done very well. But what I mean by this is that the internet sleuths make the viewers either question the case and become angry or make the viewer angry at them for spouting conspiracy nonsense. However, at the end of the series when all is revealed it becomes clear that the entire time these internet sleuths that claimed to be the good guys were actually the antagonists of the story. They are the true villains. Their screen time is to show you how deeply concerning it is to have people latch onto cases like this to hinder the investigation at best and ruin lives at the worst. While some regret their decisions, notice how none of them ever mention Morbid or say how their actions had severe consequences. They don't take responsibility for their actions and their obsession is destructive in a very criminal way. One of the sleuths even talks about how he visited Lam's grave for closure. Clearly this person is not healthy even after everything they believed is proved wrong. They are in denial because they don't want to be the bad guy. They don't want to accept the truth or that their actions have consequences. This is what made me furious and I hope it made you furious as well because this is a never ending tale. This is just one example of how destructive people can be online when they are arrogant enough to think they know more about a case than the professionals investigating it. The video of the one youtuber saying ""I have reviewed this case for hours and I completely disagree with the coroner"" is a perfect example of how delusional an average person can become when they get sucked into a web of lies. It's also an example of how these sleuths are being mocked because they clearly are part of the problem. While the sleuths might have thought they had screen time for their ""research"", in actuality they had screen time so we can see first hand how someone that does this thinks and acts.

Conclusion:
This series is not traditional true crime. It's a stretch to even call it true crime. But it is very clever in disguising itself as true crime to get it's point across.

Yes it has a lot of issues, it drags often, it's repetitive, it has poorly done production in parts but it is not irresponsible like many have said. If anything, it's more responsible than most true crime series out right now. It's not glorifying the case, it is demonizing those that distorted it for internet clout or other personal satisfaction. You're allowed to still dislike it though, this doesn't make it a good documentary but I felt it deserved a fair defense for what it's goal was.

netflix,"Documentary on ""White Salamander"" (Mormon Church) Forgery I'm &gt;!wondering why Mark Hofmann did not get the death penalty. He destroyed so many lives and never expressed remorse. The final episode cites hi m as saying that he feels no remorse for his victims, who were literally blown apart (their blood literally drenched the Salt Lake City crime scenes).!&lt;

&gt;!To see him smiling and even grinning in the closing credits updating his \[sic\] life was revolting. I remember the firing squad execution that led to Norman Mailer's ""The Executioner's Song.""!&lt;

The documentary was repetitive and tedious in the third episode specifically because it praised his ""genius"" rather than explained the legal maneuvers that won him life in prison rather than execution. If anyone deserved to be removed from the planet, it was this animal. Apologies--many, many apologies--if any of his children or heartbreaking ex-wife should by chance read this post, but I was stunned that the BBC, usually a first-rate source for documentaries, dropped the ball big-time on this one.

Another thing that would have been interesting is some discourse on why bombings flourished in the 80's and early 90's. Bombings seemed the serial killer modus operandi of choice in that era. (Unabomber, World Trade Center 1993, etc.)

If Netflix allowed ratings, I'd give this one a 5 out of 10.

(tl;dr at end)

after watching ""The Punisher""s Season 2 a week ago with Frank's young companion called Madani and now ""Polar"" with another young girl at the side of a retired contract killer I'm kinda curious if there's other movies/series with ""bad guys"", who are more cold hearted like Frank or this Hitman guy from Polar in company with younger actors that ""learn"" from them and travel with them. 

I'd rather look for something more similar to Frank and Madani's kinda relationship, because they had more action scenes together and over all their whole bond was thicker and all that stuff, also I didn't like the fact that the girl from Polar was turbo depressed all the time, but I liked the idea of a ""villian"" watching over a younger companion.

I'm constantly amazed that a company with Netflix's resources can't seem to make an app that doesn't crash or run sluggishly. I unsubscribed from Netflix a year ago because their support was utterly clueless and told me the workaround was to unplug my Roku TV for 1 minute every time the app acts up. Well, that would be fine if it actually fixed it but it doesn't.

So before I start heading back in the unsubscribing direction, does anyone have a clever way to get their garbage app to actually function?

**EDIT:** Scroll down to kneelray's advice. Turning off the auto-play features (options available only through the website) appears to have completely fixed the lag and crashing. Log in to the Netflix website and then go to **account &gt; profile &gt; playback settings &gt; change** and turn off the auto-play features. Note: you have to make this change while logged in as the primary account and change it for every profile if you have more than one.

Only after adding it to my log (i.e. a spreadsheet where I note everything) did I notice my error and the fact that my first download of this episode, done yesterday, had been 107 MB whereas today’s was 186 MB.

My log doubly confirms the discrepancy: the first took 2m34s to download while the second took 4m25s. The ratio of these times matches the 74% ratio of the sizes.

Needless to say, I checked the settings and the “Download Video Quality” is set to “Standard” on both devices.

netflix,"I am enraged at how bad Crime Scene: The Vanishing at the Cecil Hotel is. Here’s just a list of the things that are infuriating me about this doc:

1. They have multiple “internet sleuths” as experts. Now, I’m all for the internet sleuthing movement, and I don’t mind them being interviewed if they played a roll in the case (like that don’t mess with cats show), but somebody just blogging about a case does not make them an expert.

2. Somebody said “I’ve spent hundreds of hours on this case.” So a week? You spent a week? So what?

3. Somebody else said they’ve spent hours on the case and disagree with the medical examiner. Jesus, who cares if you do.

4. Multiple people claiming she isn’t acting like she is bipolar because they haven’t seen someone who is bipolar acting that way before. Wow.

5. They are OBSESSED with the hatch being open and claim that’s proof she was thrown in. Um...why couldn’t she close it herself as she went in? Why is that deemed impossible and ignored? Is it more likely it would be left open in that case? Sure, but that doesn’t make the other option impossible.

6. Apparently the Cecil is a hell mouth. They act like evil is drawn there or some bullshit.

I love a Netflix doc drone shot as much as the next guy, but this is seriously one of the most unnecessary true crime docs I’ve ever seen. This story has been done to death before this doc, and if I can get the whole story in a 20 minute YouTube video, you have to give me a reason why you are making a 4 hour doc about it.

Edit: I wanted to say I posted this while starting episode 4. Spoilers, but for them to basically all admit it was probably just an accident and explain why EVERYTHING they brought up in episodes 1-3 was wrong really drove home the pointlessness of this show. I really liked how they handled the story of the musician though.

Edit 2: Those of you saying “you missed the point, the internet sleuths were bad,” you are giving this far too much credit.

You need a policeman to get that information for you. Also, aren't drivers from the mafia taught how to tell when they are being tailed? Especially when it's from their home to their place of work by the SAME car?

Where did she get the knockout serum? You just cant pick that up at your local pharmacy.

Where did she get the two tazers? One of them police grade... in such little time?

How did she know what level to go to in the parking garage to kidnap a literal MAFIA BOSS?

She was drugged twice, they put (i'm assuming) alcohol down her gullet to make it seem like she was drinking when the car crashed, why wasn't she still drunk and high as a kite from the drugs but instasober conveniently right before the car crashed? 



Also The Mafia. They would have taken her friend they knocked out at the apartment to the quarry and started to chop off all her fingers in front of her to see where the diamonds were. No info? Ok then. They would have finished killing her friend, then started in on her by chopping the fingers off. That usually breaks most people. After they got the info, they would have confirmed the info then shot her in the face, then buried her in the quarry or just simply left her there. None of this ""make it look natural bullshit"" especially if they are dumping a car in a river. If she's going to go missing, then you dont leave anything up to chance and kill her right then and there and then disappear the body. WTF, dumbest mafia ever.

As for his mom. Why didn't the lawyer guy waltz into the Managers office with the two beefcakes side by side and set the case of  $150 grand down on his table to bribe the release? Why didn't he show pictures of the lady they just killed telling him the jig is up and not to fuck with them? You dont TAZE the fucker in the hallway for everyone to see.

netflix,"""Don’t misunderstand ‘The Vanishing at the Cecil Hotel’"" Just came across this OpEd by Chris Lambert, that helped me understand the reasoning behind the filmmakers' decision to include footage of the web sleuths in the ""*Vanishing...*"" Netflix documentary about Elisa Lam. Reddit is mentioned, which really got my attention. Here are some excerpts:

&gt; There is controversy around the Netflix documentary about the death of 21-year-old Elisa Lam at the Cecil Hotel in Los Angeles back in 2013. It mainly centers on the inclusion of “web sleuths” and YouTubers featured in the 4-episode *Crime Scene* series. The controversy boils down to two factors.  
&gt;  
&gt;First, the web sleuths and YouTubers do not come off well in the documentary. Overreaching, obsessive, irresponsible, infuriating—those adjectives about sum up the bulk of the reactions I saw others have (and felt myself).  
&gt;  
&gt;There’s a whole Reddit post with TWENTY-THOUSAND UPVOTES and over 100 awards (kind of a big deal in the Reddit community) that’s titled, “Why I stopped watching the Elisa Lam documentary.”

The point of the article, and I'm paraphrasing is that one explanation for the reasoning behind including the web sleuths is ""Show, don't tell"". 

&gt;So imagine if *Vanishing* simply told us the web sleuths and YouTubers were annoying. Maybe the detective or journalist would say, “The online sleuths and YouTubers spread a lot of misinformation that caused a lot of issues.” We’d probably believe them. But that statement wouldn’t make a lasting impression on us. It’s information rather than experience. There’s no action. No demonstration.  
&gt;  
&gt;Berlinger is very aware of the power of experience. So he brings in the sleuths and YouTubers, letting us see, first-hand, what they’re like. And, yeah, they make your blood boil.

So, I've finished the 4th episode where the psychiatrist David has fired the assistant Louise.

I am loving the series because the acting is amazing, the shots are beautifully done and the character building is so amazing that it'll kill you with slow burn! But it just seems to have a lot of unanswered questions that keep increasing. Does it answer everything in the end or I'm supposed to take those hints and turn them into facts?I think it's taking tooo long to put clarity in the context.

For example:- Adele dreaming and finding that David is cheating on her. Is that a supernatural power or just guestimate dreaming?- Adele waking up from multiple dreams inside dreams (like inception). What's up with that?- Rob dead in the forest (wearing the clothes he was wearing with Adele).

netflix,"My first impressions on Age of Samurai Battle for Japan I’m a pretty big history buff and have studied the sengoku jidai (Japanese Warring state period) on my own.

But I wanna give my opinions on this show’s first episode as I haven’t seen anyone else talk about it yet. If y’all are interested I’ll make a post about my final thoughts on the series when I finish it.

Historically speaking. They get a lot of facts right. I like that. They give exact events. People involved, people’s death, battles, who was related to who and in what manner, etc. That being said there’s a handful of subjective stuff that feels like it’s pandering towards weebs. I’m a bit of a weeb myself so I can identify weeb pandering when I see it. Saying the Samurai were the best warriors in history? The katana is the finest sword ever made??? This is stuff hardcore weebs say just because they think everything Japanese is best. Don’t get me wrong, I admire the katana and respect the skill of the Samurai, but you can’t label anything as the best when it comes to history because it’s much more complicated than that. Granted it’s subjective, but it feels like pandering. There’s only one hard thing they try to sell as fact that’s just blatantly wrong. Nobunaga was not the first person to use Ashigaru. Ashigaru had been around for a long time and were extensively used by every faction during this period of Japanese history. They’re also a little off when it comes to weapons. I do like the accuracy when they talk about guns. The specific number Nobunaga used, the advantages and disadvantages, and they weren’t wrong about how Nobunaga helped normalize the use of guns. And while the katana is definitely an iconic weapon every samurai used, they kinda passed up spears/pole arms and the bow. The samurai used bows extensively and I don’t even think they mention it. Bows were one of the reasons others didn’t use guns, because it was said in the early days “a skilled bowman could loose 15 arrows in the time it took a musket man to reload”. Everything else I really like and they did a good job portraying most informative.

When it comes to cinematography I have really just two things to say. This looks great...except why is it so grey and dark. The costumes, the acting, the choreography, everything is great, except this dark filter they have on everything, even the historians talking. Idk why but I personally found this kinda stupid and annoying. I think it’s because it feels like they were trying to go for a Ghosts of Tsushima vibe which makes me feel like this was pandering a little bit. Aside from that, everything else looks great. Normally I’d complain about the chaotic battles with no formation, but the battles they depicted were in fact quite chaotic in the forests so I actually don’t have a problem with that.

Overall I like the show for the most part, it’s mostly accurate but misses a couple things. It does feel like they have a very specific audience they’re trying to pander to at times. Show is too dark and unnecessarily grey, but the costumes and action are amazing. I don’t want my criticism to make the show seem bad, it was just easier to say the few things they did wrong vs everything they did right",impression age samurai battle japan pretty big history buff study sengoku jidai japanese warring state period expert hobby historian understand documentary dramatic stuff wanna opinion episode talk interested post final thought series finish historically speak lot fact right like exact event people involve people death battle relate manner etc handful subjective stuff feel like pander weebs bit weeb identify weeb pander samurai good warrior history katana fine sword stuff hardcore weebs think japanese good wrong admire katana respect skill samurai label good come history complicated grant subjective feel like pander hard thing try sell fact blatantly wrong nobunaga person use ashigaru ashigaru long time extensively use faction period japanese history little come weapon like accuracy talk gun specific number nobunaga use advantage disadvantage wrong nobunaga help normalize use gun katana definitely iconic weapon samurai use kinda pass spear pole arm bow samurai use bow extensively think mention bows reason use gun early day skilled bowman loose arrow time musket man reload like good job portray informative come cinematography thing look great grey dark costume acting choreography great dark filter historian talk idk personally find kinda stupid annoying think feel like try ghosts tsushima vibe feel like pander little bit aside look great normally complain chaotic battle formation battle depict fact chaotic forest actually problem overall like accurate miss couple thing feel like specific audience try pander time dark unnecessarily grey costume action amazing want criticism bad easy thing wrong vs right,596,0.08642072213500786,positive,0

netflix,"I Care A Lot - Good Movie With a Failed Moral? - [Spoiler Warning - Discusses Plot] Hey all,

Just finished ""I Care A Lot"". Honestly I thought it was a fairly well put together and entertaining movie/plot.

HOWEVER, I did take issue with Marla being the protagonist. Were we supposed to feel sorry for what happened to her in the end? Were we supposed to take this as some sort of feminist triumph over men?

Like Marla was a horrible horrible person who deserved most of what happened to her (maybe just short of the murder attempt). At not point did I feel like I should be rooting for her to come out on top. Also, I got the impression that we were supposed to feel like she was sticking it to the ""man"", like it somehow empowered women, but if I had a daughter I wouldn't show them a movie that frames a horrible person as the female heroine.

And what is the deal with that ""achieve your dreams""/Crime and Punishment monologue at the beginning/end? Are we supposed to  really think that she was in any way actually successful? She got rich by manipulating people....that is not the universal definition of success...",care lot good movie failed moral spoiler warning discusses plot hey finish care lot honestly think fairly entertaining movie plot issue marla protagonist suppose feel sorry happen end suppose sort feminist triumph man like marla horrible horrible person deserve happen maybe short murder attempt point feel like root come impression suppose feel like stick man like empower woman daughter movie frame horrible person female heroine deal achieve punishment monologue beginning end suppose think way actually successful rich manipulate people universal definition success,204,0.05921052631578947,positive,0

netflix,"Avatar Legends of Korra.... we really want more.... I'll start off that i liked The last airbender.... But i loved The Legends of Korra. 

I never watched cartoons or any shit like that. i remember seeing eps of TLAB when i was a teen, but never invested into it. Jumped on nextflix around December and saw it. So i was like hmmm its familiar and something to catch up on, then i saw The Legends Of Korra. Now i was told it was crap and blah blah, but im no sheep ill find thing out for myself. I'm not a super hard guy, but i dont break down unless its a pet or loved that has died. 

&amp;#x200B;

Korra put me into tears... and her ending felt more like a Cliffhanger then a ending. I Mean she says ""there is soo much i want to see and do as this new avatar"" She grows soo much and suffers alot during the way. every enemy she faced took away apart of her. she went from this bratty kid to a strong compassionate woman. And her Love with Asami.... 

&amp;#x200B;

We need more of that. I'm not even gay it feels wrong we cant see them share a kiss or be inlove... We all want to see Korra and Asami be in love, we also want to see this new mature compassionate avatar in at least 2 more seasons. What could a future story arc be?

Well do the comics but with animation... Comics are fillers, not story tellers, these comics take to long and rush through everything. I mean there is bugger all story... anyway Animate the comics fill them out give them more story... 

Then the last season we see Korra at 26 awaken from a nightmare seeing Aang fight off dark spirits. Asami is woken up by Korra to ask what happened. for korra to just say it was a past lifes nightmare... She might no longer connected to them but she is still a part of that cycle... 2 days later spirits start pouring out of a portal for Korra to investigate, She goes and askes a spirit what is going on it replies with ""your kind as destorying the spirit world"" Korra replies ""humans have not been destroying the spirit world"" the spirit would reply with ""NO! your kind avatar!"" So this could be a season where she finds out the past lives wernt destroyed... they where disconnected from Rava when she was destroyed....   
Rava is a nexus, she connected all the Past and current avatars together, and when rava died. they thought Korra died in avatar state and the cycle was broken.

These past lives went out into the spirit world to find other avatars that where out and got lost when this all happened. and 80% that left were caught by bad spirits that had messed with avatars and imprisoned or devoured them...

netflix,"4k streaming quality Hi All,

I recently got a 4k TCL C716 TV mainly to watch Netflix in 4k. TCLs packaging has the Netflix logo all over it so assumed its officially compatible. The quality of the TVs software is awful (not been updated in my region, full of security holes) and one of the remotes was broken.

Anyway, when I watch FHD content - i.e. shows that support 1080p only - it looks really good. But when I watch any 4k content then there is a ""static"" or coloured dot effect over the whole picture which is extremely noticeable. This effect isn't noticeable in YouTube or other apps. There also doesn't seem to be a way to force the TV to play 4k content in 1080p (although obviously this would defeat the point of the TV!).

I checked the TV Netflix app and it reports 90Mbps to Netflix. Fast.com from a web browser reports 33Mbps (compared to 430Mbps on the computer....), however, in video stats say 15.25Mbps. It doesn't look like a compression artifact though.

I talked to Netflix support and they weren't able to suggest anything. I'm really confused if this is likely to be a Netflix app issue, the TV just being generally bad (wouldn't recommend TCL) or something else.

Wanted to see if anyone on here has the same experience or any suggestions?

netflix,"I Care A Lot abuse of the suspension of disbelief? I am not even gonna go into the mental gymnastics the viewer is required to take in order to root for the scum of human being that Marla is. At the end of the day, she is a con artist taking advantage of vulnerable elder people to steal their property.

I just wanna focus on the incredible and improbable mess that occurs after Marla and Frankie are apprehended by Tyrion's men and how it heavily relies on a major dose of suspension of disbelief. 

1. Marla says the easiest way to solve their issue is for Tyrion to pay her 10 million and they both go their ways. Tyrion rejects that and decides to kill her. Wouldn't the actual easiest option be to simply force Marla to sign some sort of legal document releasing Ms Peterson from her guardianship? Marla definitely has a way to accomplish this as we see in the end that Ms Peterson is released from the psychiatric facility and reunited with her son. Also, Tyrion's men already have Frankie so they could somehow use that as leverage to force Marla into giving up. 
2. Anybody who has ever seen a crime movie (or has the tiniest bit of common sense) knows that a henchman/hitman would make sure the person they are told to kill is actually dead. However, both for Frankie and Marla, the henchmen apparently simply thought it was over and went about their nights. Would have hurt for them to stand by the lake and make sure Marla did not somehow escaped? Would have hurt for them to stand by the apartment until it blew up?
3. Are we really supposed to believe a middle aged woman (would say the same thing if it was a middle aged man) was able to single-handedly defeat the security team of Russian mobster? Not only that, but it was somewhat convenient that right when Marla was at the driver's house he was about to leave to meet Tyrion. It was very convenient that the bathroom Marla asked the front desk guy about was in the direction of a door towards the executive parking promptly open by someone else. And it was extremely convenient than in a massive office building with a bunch of parking levels she was able to find exactly Tyrion's driver right around the corner. 
4. A Russian mobster only has one security guard? 
5. How did Marla end up at/find the hospital where Tyrion was taken and how she managed to be assigned as her legal guardian so they could have this extremely productive business meeting?

It might not seem like it, but I did enjoy the movie and felt like it was going in a great direction right before this mess. Guess that's what happens when you just can't figure out how to tie everything up for the conclusion.

netflix,"""The Chalet"" Crib Sheet I just got finished erasing from my Ipad the fictional cast and their relation to each other. For those who have not seen it, this is from memory, but it might help you avoid rewatching the first two episodes. The story is told in flashback from 2017, when literally everyone in the isolated Alpine town of Valmoline comes together to celebrate a marriage between two couples: Manu and Adele; and Laurent and Erika (see below).

**1997**\-- The chalet's tenants: **Jean-Louis Rodier** (writer, not from Valmoline); **Francoise**, (his wife, **from** Valmoline); **Julien** (the Rodiers' thirteen-year-old son); **Amelie** (their very young daughter). **Alexandre** (Francoise's hermit cousin).

Town locals: **Philippe** (a former admirer and perhaps lover of Francoise) ; **Muriel**, (his unmarried sister); **Florence** (Philippe's shopkeeper/souvenir-hut-owning wife); **Etienne** (a guy in love with Muriel and angry at her instant infatuation with the suave Jean-Louis); **Christine** (a relation, possibly sister, of Etienne). **Milou**, Valmoline's cabinet-maker, employs **Gaspard**, who drinks a lot with Philippe and Etienne. Milou is the father of the coveted young Alice, rivalry over whom brings Julien (see above) to blows--and then some--with Sebastian, Laurent, and Thierry.

The integral adolescent cast includes as thirteen-year-olds Philippe's sons, **Laurent** and **Thierry.** They do not speak in the 1997 segment but appear as ""muscle"" for the local bully, **Sebastian**. Sebastian is Etienne's son and in love with **Alice.**  Finally, there is **Manu**, not a local boy, but one whom both Alice and Sebastian claim as BFFs during Manu's summer visits. The viewer never meets Manu's parents.

**2017**\-- Laurent brings **Erika (blonde)** to a train station in Chambery. They are going to marry in Valmoline (God only knows where :). Thierry brings **Tiphaine (redhead)**, his girlfriend. Manu, having already arrived by car with **Adele (blonde)**, greets his business partner, **Olivier**, and Olivier's partner **Mathilde**, and her very young daughter **Leonore**. Sebastian also arrives by car with **Maud**, a gorgeous  and friendly showroom model in the car-importing business Sebastian has built for himself with funds whose source the unfolding series eventually explains.

One final local, **Paul**, seems to be a postman who travels back and forth (in both 1997 and 2017) between Valmoline and the outer-world.

If I were to suggest which characters are integral to this mini-series--without giving away any of its mystery or plot--I would suggest you pay attention to **Jean-Louis**; **Muriel**, the young **Philippe**; and, in 2017, **Alice** and **Sebastian**.

netflix,"The last Paradiso is terrible I want to preface this by saying that I’m originally from southern Italy so the setting and premises are somewhat familiar to me.

That said, I found the whole thing almost unbearable. It’s one of the worst films I’ve had the misfortune of watching.

The writing is banal, the acting is embarrassing. Everyone seem to have a different accent even though they’re supposed to come from the same tiny village (probably this won’t be evident to those watching it in English)

netflix,"""Audio in (language)"" search returns shows that don't have audio in the searched for language [US] I'm not sure if anyone else has any experience with this, but generally searching for Audio in (language) will return all of the shows that have audio/dubbing in that language. It seems to work consistently for every language I have tried except for one result that appears to be a bug. When I search for Audio in Catalan all of the shows that result from the search have Catalan audio except for Card Captor Sakura. I can't tell if this is a bug where this should not return in the results because US Netflix does not have the licensing or if Netflix has the correct licensing but there is a bug enabling the audio. It has European Spanish dubbing and Netflix Spain has it in Catalan, so my guess is the former. It's also possible I'm wrong and the search doesn't work in the way it seems like it should, so I'd appreciate knowing if other people have had seen similar things and I'm just barking up the wrong tree.

What I’ve noticed is that when English subtitles are enabled, subtitles only appear for dialogues where the characters speak English.

However, when the dialogue is spoken in Japanese, no translated English subtitles are present, so effectively I’m missing out on a chunk of the movie since there’s a lot of Japanese dialogue present. Adding to this, when I disabled the subtitles option, subtitles automatically appear for the Japanese dialogue translated to English.

Is there any way to perhaps enable English subtitles for both English and Japanese dialogue for this film?

A good example of this in action is Riverdale. Feeling frustrated recently about this I set about to do some investigation after determining elsewhere that it was possible to get better picture quality than what I was receiving.

Long story short, the official Windows 10 app on Windows 20H2 receives video in AVC at half the bitrate of the new Edge browser which receives it in AVCHIGH at the bitrate you are paying for. 

With the bitrate cut 50% for the 1920x1080 resolution using the official Netflix Windows 10 app, you would actually get better picture quality in comparison using silverlight at 720p instead.

Unfortunately, using Netflix in a browser doesn't give you a choice between 5.1 and 2.0 sound which the app does, but picture quality is more important to me so I am forced to use the new Edge browser.",psa picture quality use edge browser windows app point frustration find number title serve blurry wash encode good example action riverdale feel frustrated recently set investigation determine possible picture quality receive long story short official windows app windows receive video avc half bitrate new edge browser receive avchigh bitrate pay bitrate cut resolution use official windows app actually picture quality comparison use silverlight instead unfortunately use browser choice sound app picture quality important force use new edge browser,178,0.11347687400318977,positive,0

netflix,"Need Help With Auto-Play - Potentially a Bug? Hello all. So on Netflix Kids my two year old loves the show Motown Magic. Usually I'll give him some TV time around lunch and just let it run while I work but this show specifically does not auto play. We have auto play on, and it works on other shows. Specifically with Motown Magic, it plays only one episode and then when it stops doesn't play anything (not even another show) except for a preview on repeat.

Additionally when I select the show off the menu, the default episode is always the very last episode, even if I go back to the very beginning and play the first episode from the beginning. The episode will end, nothing will play, and when I go to select a new episode it's always on the last one (and plays from the end credits). It's pretty frustrating because the episodes are only 10 mins long, and considering he gets limited TV time I'd like for it to be something he enjoys.

netflix,"The Vanishing at Cecil Hotel is problematic and absolutely terrible Spoilers if you haven't watched it...

&amp;#x200B;

I've tried to put my thoughts into words, but I'm also not the best reviewer so.. yeah:

I watched the Cecil Hotel documentary the other day and when I finished it, I felt frustrated. The more it’s come up in conversation, of which has not yet been very positive, I’ve felt a seething anger at the documentary more and more and I’ve come to the conclusion that it’s not even bad, it’s just outright disrespectful and imo a disgusting approach to telling a story.

First of all, the actual documentary is \~decent\~ and as somebody who knew the bare minimum of this case (based on spooky videos I watched when I was 15), I felt rather informed by it. Its first two episodes do a good job in telling the situation of the case, the context is a bit mix-matched and the manager makes me uncomfortable, but overall, the set up and the story of the case was a standard documentary. I’m pretty sure I could have stopped there and felt pretty satisfied with the documentary.

However, its primarily the third episode which frustrated me the most, or at least it’s complete tonal contradiction to the final episode. You see, part 3 explains the different theories based around Elisa Lam, which are all highlights of Web Sleuth culture. Ridiculous theories based on silly information, which is fair enough if you’re covering this topic and all – but to entertain these theories is completely disrespectful to the following episode, which I will touch on soon. At no point does it really give any sense of validity to these ideas and ultimately, they’re played off as cooky conspiracies, which I won’t lie – they pretty much are. I spent the duration of the ‘horror movie in action’ theory rolling my eyes and actually muttering to myself “and what?”, because it’s stupid. The theory Elisa Lam was a secret agent sent to spread TB? Good movie plot about corruption, bad take on a woman’s tragic death. It also entertains paranormal activity and all these ridiculous ideas, and it angers me so much.

The primary issue I have with episode 3 is that it is quickly followed by a huge tonal shift, centred around a message about Elisa Lam’s mental health. It’s only until episode 4 we learn a lot of key information for what most likely happened (her medication, her depression, her strange activity). Episode 4 appears to set out about mental health and its connection to this tragic tale of a woman’s death. We even see Morbid who may discomfort me with his art style, but nonetheless is a victim of the web sleuths. And while the episode appears to focus on this and focus on the crippling affects it had on him, it still entertained these ridiculous notions the episode earlier. It glorified these people, despite the next episode having this façade and pretence of passionate take on mental health. It’s disgusting.

It’s completely problematic and I’ve not seen such a half-assed and shallow message on mental health in my life. Were this a documentary about the Cecil Hotel alone, it would work with an episode or a segment on Elisa Lam, detailing the case and how she met her tragic fate related to her suffering mental health, it would work. Were this ultimately a take on web sleuth culture, the crippling damages it can have on the web sleuth, the people they pursue and the investigations they seek out, it would work. But no. Instead, the final episode concludes the intended message of mental health, as though it hadn’t spent the past episode entertaining such ridiculous theories for an hour. It acts as though it skipped past the affects on Morbid. It shed no light on the family, their struggle dealing with the loss of a daughter and a sister – nor her friends. In the end, the documentary is a disrespectful and shallow attempt to entice web sleuths into an internet mystery and ultimately wrap it up in a nice, cute message about awareness to mental illness, as though the makers really cared about that final message, as opposed to explaining the mystery?

I genuinely have so many issues with this and it really angers me how they approached this genuinely tragic story. I do think the historian and I believe sociologists (I may be wrong, but the woman who discusses Elisa Lam and the man who discusses the homeless population in skid row) were on right tracks of approaching this story. The web sleuths seem so detached from the actual case and I can’t explain how uncomfortable it is to see one of the main web sleuths say how he had someone go to her grave and touch it for him, as though she’s barely a person? I don’t know, it’s just the web sleuths don’t feel as though they fully understand what they’re in the midst in and while I appreciated one of the web sleuths’ reflections on his actions, the whole ordeal fully showcases why you shouldn’t entertain these theories, because you attract detached people from the original case. They felt inconvenienced and ultimately dissatisfied with the likely answer, which is apparently is the ultimate message of the documentary?

Maybe I’m overthinking it, but I’ve actually never been so outraged in my life by a show and the more I think about it, the more frustrated I get? I think the documentary is okay, it’s pretty bad but it’s actual case study (bar episode 3) somewhat works. It’s interesting, but it’s focusing on the wrong thing, which ultimately makes its final message feel super disingenuous. I feel informed, which a documentary should seek out to do, but these producers had this final episode in mind when shooting the 3rd, and yet despite having dedicated the final episode to a mental health message, still entertained these ridiculous and irrelevant, ungrounded and frustrating theories.",vanishing cecil hotel problematic absolutely terrible spoiler try thought word good reviewer yeah cecil hotel documentary day finish feel frustrated come conversation positive feel seethe anger documentary come conclusion bad outright disrespectful imo disgusting approach tell story actual documentary somebody know bare minimum case base spooky video feel inform episode good job tell situation case context bit mix match manager uncomfortable overall set story case standard documentary pretty sure stop feel pretty satisfied documentary primarily episode frustrate complete tonal contradiction final episode explain different theory base elisa lam highlight web sleuth culture ridiculous theory base silly information fair cover topic entertain theory completely disrespectful follow episode touch soon point sense validity idea ultimately play cooky conspiracy wo lie pretty spend duration horror movie action theory roll eye actually mutter stupid theory elisa lam secret agent send spread tb good movie plot corruption bad woman tragic death entertain paranormal activity ridiculous idea anger primary issue episode quickly follow huge tonal shift centre message elisa lam mental health episode learn lot key information likely happen medication depression strange activity episode appear set mental health connection tragic tale woman death morbid discomfort art style nonetheless victim web sleuth episode appear focus focus crippling affect entertain ridiculous notion episode early glorify people despite episode façade pretence passionate mental health disgusting completely problematic half assed shallow message mental health life documentary cecil hotel work episode segment elisa lam detail case meet tragic fate relate suffer mental health work ultimately web sleuth culture crippling damage web sleuth people pursue investigation seek work instead final episode conclude intend message mental health spend past episode entertain ridiculous theory hour act skip past affect morbid shed light family struggle deal loss daughter sister friend end documentary disrespectful shallow attempt entice web sleuth internet mystery ultimately wrap nice cute message awareness mental illness maker care final message oppose explain mystery genuinely issue anger approach genuinely tragic story think historian believe sociologist wrong woman discuss elisa lam man discuss homeless population skid row right track approach story web sleuth detached actual case explain uncomfortable main web sleuth grave touch barely person know web sleuth feel fully understand midst appreciate web sleuth reflection action ordeal fully showcase entertain theory attract detached people original case feel inconvenienced ultimately dissatisfy likely answer apparently ultimate message documentary maybe overthinke actually outraged life think frustrated think documentary okay pretty bad actual case study bar episode somewhat work interesting focus wrong thing ultimately final message feel super disingenuous feel informed documentary seek producer final episode mind shoot despite dedicate final episode mental health message entertain ridiculous irrelevant ungrounded frustrating theory,1003,-0.024604444850923727,negative,0

But I think it is wrong to not point out that this is a girl from the middle of the country that has no city experience decides to go into the heart of skid row Los Angeles one of the most dangerous places in America and take over a hotel with the worst reputation imaginable and make it a better place and she's the woman up for that job. That takes courage that takes balls that I wish I had and that I wish we all had. My hat goes after her Come out with all her eccentricities, she at times comes off as flawed but no more or less than any of us. 
2) Conspiracy theories- These days it seems like maybe because of the time everybody has on their hands that conspiracy theories are more rampant than ever before. Now, I started thinking, how many conspiracy theories have ever come to light as actual explanations to mysteries? Maybe somebody out there can point to things once considered conspiracies theories that turned out to be true, but I know of none. In this case, we see how true this is. The name of the 
3) Paranormal Activity, and the proclivity to assume it does actually exist, and is to blame for negative or strange events. I blame nobody for believing what they want to believe that is a right that we all have. But assuming paranormal activity might be at fault for anything that has happened will put you in a rabbit hole that will never end in a positive manner and for those that do believe in paranormal activity, Maybe it does maybe it doesn't, but let's not swear our credibility on it. Especially in a missing person case. 
4) Web sleuths. Here is a great example of how grouping people into one type or moniker is usually never a good thing to do, because not everybody who decided to try and help this investigation was necessarily hurtful to the investigation or guilty of pointing pointing their finger at innocent people. Now this isn't to say that We shouldn't feel sympathy for the metal singer who was falsely accused and put some blame on those who made his life so difficult that he attempted suicide. But I have to point to 2 things in this docuseries that really are heartwarming. The couple that films the hotel Really does fascinating and helpful work that, Had she been murdered could have opened a lot of doors as to the reason. 
But the star here is John Siobhan, the soft spoken, mild mannered person that took interest. When he mentions that after reading her blog how he felt heartbroken and infuriated at the same time we come to know him and realise that here is somebody that is so empathetic and so smart... How come we all don't raise our children the way his parents did so that he came out that way? And how come we don't make him president of this country for life because I fell in love with this person during this film and if he ever happens to read this my hat goes off to you sir you are the best of us.
5) Coincidences. Oh, you darn coincidences. David Lynch once wrote in Lost Highway, ""I don't believe in bad coincidences. Coincidences spook us out for sure because they are mathematical anomalies. But here's the thing, if coincidence didn't exist then somebody mathematic like myself would be really worried because it is an absolute certainty that the more people on Earth exist, living their lives, the more mathematical coincidences will occur. And the more people there are LOOKING for answers to things, the more coincidences there will be. Coincidences exist, you'll run into plenty in your life, and they'll be just that, random, mathematical coincidences. 
6) Mental illness, and its prominence in society- As someone with a fairly severe mental illness, I know far more than I want to about mental illnesses. Over the course of my life, having spent several days in treatment facilities, it became clear to me early in life that mental illnesses are no different than physical ones in their degrees of harmfulness, except that they're easier to ignore because they aren't physically noticeable to others much of the time, as they're occurring in the afflicted's brains, hidden from the world, and only actually provable in a brain scan. But its important for those unafflicted to become more aware that the behaviors of those that are. 
This is even more evident when these youtubers start Commenting about how her bipolar disorder definitely could not be the reason that she was found dead. Here's the problem, these people that say this clearly have never met anybody or cared about anybody who is afflicted with bipolar disorder. It is one of the most savagely terrible things that can occur in the brain and can cause the best person in the world to act as irrational and dangerous and poor mannered to act unruly. As soon as Her death is ruled because of her bipolar disorder, there is a frenzy of doubt that pops up and that really points even more directly to the fact that people who don't know how serious and how potentially deadly serious chemical imbalances are. And it almost doesn't matter whether that is actually why she died or not, The bigger issue here is that Mental illness is something that needs to be destigmatised, talked about more in AND out of the medical community, and FAR more money needs to be allotted by the government to help those afflicted. 
But as I can attest to personally, When somebody has mental disorder even the most loving parents are left in the dark most of the time and if they don't have the time and resources to do the research it's very hard for them to realise the real degree of severity of their child's illness. Elisa's parents NEVER Should have allowed her to travel on her own. Now of course she was an adult and she could do whatever she wanted to, But this is why it's even more important to make sure that parents are well aware and understand early on that they are going to have to do things that most parents won't even deep into their child's life to help protect themselves from a sickness that there is no cure too and that there is only differing degrees of help for, And in a lot of cases as we tragically see here, it is so easy for somebody with mental illness to not take their medication even for a short period of time and have their behaviour change radically on a dime. Obviously her parents are not to blame, but I think what we need to take from this is that it is just a terrible tragedy how little amounts of information and help are out there that need to be. 
I think Elisa would want nothing more than to have helped change these unfortunate, terrible facts. And my hat goes off and I just have so much love and respect for Ron Howard and Brian glazer who made this movie. I believe they are well aware of how tragic mental illness really is and how much more information and attention and money and help and all of that needs to go to mental illness and they wanted to help and they realised that just talking about it has yet to work. So by putting this absolutely fascinating documentary together, that pulls anybody who watches it into it, By the end, hopefully you take this away from the movie. Was a loving good person that was trying to find herself just like we all do at that age and she wanted to travel and she had ambition and she tried to make something happen that would improve her life, but because mental illness is still to this day just a huge stigma that The vast amount of the public has no idea about how serious and how silent and hard to notice mental illness is. Read about it. Watch this film. Accept That it was mental illness that caused her death and that you might know somebody or several people that are afflicted and just bof them and realise that they may not be acting in A way that they want to or that reflects who they are.

But I can’t get over the death of Kenneka Jenkins If you are not familiar with the case of Kenneka Jenkins, you can read about it [here](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Kenneka_Jenkins) and also check out my Reddit post about her [here](https://amp.reddit.com/r/UnsolvedMurders/comments/l50h3c/the_real_question_no_one_is_asking_about_kenneka/) and you can see the video footage from the hotel [here](https://youtu.be/MmVYbeNyYEo) 


I’ve known about both the Elisa Lam and the Kenneka Jenkins cases for a while now. When I first read about the death of Elisa Lam, maybe for the first few weeks or so, I was convinced that she was killed. However after spending a lot of time researching the facts of the case and hearing almost every opinion that there was, it just makes sense to me that she died accidentally. (I pretty much think that she was off her medication and decided to climb up on the roof of the Cecil because she was in a manic episode and wanted to experience the rush/thrill and or see the skyline, and fell inside the water tank where she was unable to get out. 

I have spent even more time looking over Kenneka’s case and I just can not find any logical conclusion that could explain why she ended up in the freezer. I have seen every surveillance video, every report, every witness statement, every autopsy photograph, every social media post, pretty much every single thing that has been released to the public in compliance with the Freedom of Information Act. 

Still with all of this information, nothing convinces me in the slightest way that she voluntarily went into that freezer and stayed in there until her death. There is just no way. 

I really wish that the circumstances surrounding her death could be explained away as logically as they can with Elisa’s but they just can’t.

netflix,"Watched Red Dot and was disappointed (spoilers) I'm having a difficult time finding decent shows on Netflix lately. I think the quality has been deteriorating for awhile. They give celebrities or famous people huge production deals instead of finding fresh new talent. Almost all the shows or movies that I watch now are foreign which says something about the quality of the U.S. shows and movies. I recently watched Hinterland, The Woods and a few others. 

When I saw the trailer for Red Dot it looked interesting so I decided to watch. It was clear from the beginning that their assumption that the racist brothers were responsible was wrong. But it's not clear if the brothers were helping the person who actually wanted to kill them. The brother who is also a rescue person points a gun at them as if he is going to shoot them while they're hiding but then he is surprised when he seem them captured and about to be killed. The other brother is confused when Nadja starts backing away from him so he doesn't seem involved. 

When the brother enters the room where Thomas has Nadja and David he is shot by Thomas and David rushes over the untie Nadja. David has a power drill in his hand. Wouldn't it make more sense to kill Thomas with the drill while he is fighting with Jarmo? And why did it take so much time for Thomas to go after Nadja and David after they escaped? He wasn't injured so he must have quickly killed Jarmo. But the most frustrating part of the movie was the ending. It would have preferred the pregnant woman lived but is it believable that an intelligent woman in medical school would be overwhelmed with passion that she would attempt to fondle her boyfriend's penis while he was DRIVING A CAR. I mean COME ON. That isn't something a teenager would do let alone an intelligent medical school student. Also Thomas let his child play with a drone without any supervision but now thinks of himself as a victim when he was irresponsible. Also didn't the boy hear the car approaching? Anyway I was disappointed.

netflix,"Docu-entertainment needs limits - the Elisa Lam documentary ""Crime Scene"" goes too far Netflix completely Hollywoodized the poor girl's death.

There was no real mystery, the last 30 minutes of the final episode suddenly reveals the clear reason why she is likely to have died.

The first 3.5 episodes just create a completely false sense of mystery and suspense. The police figured out the real reason behind her death and the producers of this documentary clearly asked them to bullshit their initial thoughts for 3.5 hours to keep people guessing.

It's also completely all over the place, just random clips of internet sleuths giving their conjecture opinions, and then the show uses special effects to exaggerate what they say.

What does everyone else think? I think they hit it big time with the Docu-entertainment Tiger King and are now looking for all sorts of mysteries which they can pad out into 4+ low budget conjecture-infected episodes to keep people watching.

I think Docu-entertainment has a limit. Tiger King is a good balance - it charts a story. But this, this is just pointless, why waste the audience's time with bullshit for 3.5 episodes only to suddenly change track and solve the mystery?

netflix,"Blown Season 2 episode 4. Why are the judges talking about “hope” when that concept isn’t even hinted at in the brief? The brief was “Your finished pieces should be an inspiration for people to think about the environment and to make the changes that they can to protect our planet. “

Absolutely nothing about that brief speaks to me of creating a piece which communicates “hope” and I’d argue none of the others felt that way either. 

They created images of disaster and warning. People eating the forests. A forest balancing precariously. Ugly fast food and an ice berg wrapped up in a to-go container. 

They created pieces to inspire people to think about the environment. 

I felt like I was going crazy, like I was being gas-lit, when the guest judge is walking through the gallery and criticizing pieces for not communicating “Hope”. That wasn’t the damn prompt!

netflix,"Wow! Space Sweepers is Awsome! Netflix really needs to do a better job of advertising this Original.

If you like Guardians of the Galaxy, Anime or Star Wars, you should watch this one.

Its a fun space action adventure, the CGI is a little bit dated but they use it sparingly. 

The movie borrows alot of its visuals from Guardians, The Fifth Element, and a little bit of Snow Piercer. The characters are very much inspired from generic sci fi anime characters.

Act 1 is kind of a cliché sci fi slog but the film really hits its stride in Act 2...

Its a fun movie! Korean Cinema loves to appease cinephiles. Half the movie is in English and the other half is korean, for those of you adverse to subtitles. Its like they wanted to make a easy to watch action adventure movie that could get people who dont like subtitles to watch. And i think they accomplished their goal. They made a Scfi action romp with anime influence that tries to appeal mainstream audience.

netflix,"Elisa Lam footage is reversed and fabricated. Reverse footage tells everything, she is in conversation with someone on right, then, she enters the elevator, pretends to go away. Then comes to the corner, checks if the person has left and then lives the elevator and heads to left.

Also, why didn’t they investigate all the guest during Elisa lam visit, isn’t that standard procedure to check who all were there, including staff.

How come police checks about dumpsters but doesn’t check water tank while investigating.

They cooked up creepy fabricated video, with help of gangs and hotel staff and showed the world that she had mental issue.

netflix,"A review of the latest Netflix movie To All The Boys: Always and Forever # Trust,

Is important in relationships, Trust is hardcore, without trust, your partner would most likely be [carried away by a big bird](https://twitter.com/mindflakes/status/1152165761554821120), and unless you want that to happen, trust them.

This is exactly what’s conveyed in “To all the boys, Always and Forever: The movie”. It’s about trust and love and hope and fighting problems and Lara not letting Peter get carried away by a big bird and vice versa.

It’s also about having such a relationship that neither of you hold each other back. The movie definitely is a bit of a cliche but it’s a good type of cliche.

**It’s the type of cliche that you don’t mind it being a cliche- the good times, the sad times and despite the pain and the process- everyone gets a happy ending.**

It’s a perfect Valentine’s day watch, especially if you’re single- it can give you a bit of an insight into how relationships actually work- how the relationships that last, work.

This movie is basically about Lara Jean getting accepted into a college far away from Peter’s. They wouldn’t be able to see each other everyday, unlike what they’d first envisioned and it’s clear the both of them think that the separation would get to them, signalling the end of their relationship.

**The entire series is something people can relate to- getting embarrassed by your boyfriend’s ex who’s so clearly jealous of you, parent issues, school issues, your boyfriend’s issues, your sister issues, your issues- no matter how tiny all these problems may seem compared to the big plot- it all adds up.**

It’s all relatable and it’s all happening in the blink of an eye- this just makes the movie 2X exciting.

The final film Always and Forever serves the Internet generation.

Like a conventional high school rom-com, it has a damsel in distress, a charmingly protective boyfriend, fears of separation and a flashy prom. Yet it manages to be refreshing and enjoyable.

This movie is a successful example of how you can make cliche’s work, both by defying them and by abiding by them.

All of Lara and Peter’s decisions are doable, you yourself would have made the same decisions if you were in their shoes. The aesthetic of the movie is also something to talk about- it’s a classic Lara Jean aesthetic- pink and blue and yellow and green: the aesthetic of the movie also makes you want to stay. It also has a satisfying ending

**With this, if you are on the lookout for a cute, slightly cliched rom-com that might make you cry a little bit- To All The Boys Always and Forever is the perfect movie for you.**

netflix,"My thoughts about Crime scene: Cecil Hotel I just watched this limited series last night and for my opinion its not the best series i have watched and also not the worst i mean there are some good stuff in the series but i think netflix should've just made this a short length film. So i made a list of what are the best parts and what are the worst parts of the series.


Best Parts

1. How they found Elisa Lam's elevator footage 
2. Two europeans show the the experience at the hotel
3. The history and related stories about the hotel (including Skid Row)
4. Analyzing Elisa Lam's steps of how she got to the water tank and how she got to the cecil hotel instead of Stay on main hotel.
5. The police investigating the whole hotel (well kinda the best)

Worst/Cringey Parts
1. The Youtubers/Bloggers ""acting"" like detectives and using Elisa for content and money which is very offensive.
2. Too much useless information
3. Making Elisa Lam's tumblr posts public
4. Police investigation at the Cecil hotel's rooftop
5. Too much unrelated and off topic theories
6. The internet users are being to personal like the guy that said ""I felt like i lost a sister"" and the other people who just denies the test result and blame other people for Elisa Lam's death.
7. Very bad video editing

So i will talk about the bad/cringey parts only. 

I hate that the Youtubers/Bloggers keep acting like detectives but does not do what a detective was supposed to do they literally didn't do anything to help to the LAPD like they just literally go to the hotel and walk around and they even go to the parts of the hotel where he/she/they should not even go to.

And i also hate the guy who made the facebook group about Elisa Lam because he was being to personal and i really think he was faking it because what kind of guy or girl would share their personal feelings to the public you will just literally get more hate for that.

I also hate the people who denies the test result like they know how to this stuff i mean what they only know is to make damn useless theories and most importantly of how they blamed that artist who literally lost his career because of them and got hate messages for 7 years straight. 

I love that they put many information to this series but some of them are just not that important and will probably just waste your time.

Whoever are the police officers check the rooftop should have been more responsible just because your dog doesn't smell anything you still need to check the water tank.

And they should've have not made Elisa Lam's tumblr post public because again it was like a diary to her meaning its personal and you should not share it to the public no matter what.


So even if the LAPD, Government and the Cecil hotel employees made mistakes i still blame the internet users for this because they literally used Elisa Lam for content and money and they literally ruuned tge lives of the people they blamed. And about the General Manager i feel her it wasn't easy to change a hotel full of serial killers and homeless peopleand if she gets used to it it's still a very hard task so the real antagonist of this case are The internet users who denied the result, blamed innocent people and used Elisa Lam.

My rating for this mini series is
4.5/10

netflix,"Using someone else’s account by accident. I hope this is a good place to ask this question.

So my mom recently purchased her first ever smart TV. We were checking it out together and apparently it has someone else’s Netflix credentials already on it. My guess is someone purchased the TV, used it for a bit and returned it and the store just repackaged it.

My mom is checking out shows on this other person’s Netflix account and I’m wondering how legal this is. If this person finds out, can legal actions against my mom be taken?

In my opinion, this is a documentary about The Cecil Hotel and what happened there over the years, including the mysterious death of Elisa Lam.

We are getting a lot of history of the hotel, which makes no sense if it is a documentary about a mysterious death...unless they are trying to pass it on as a kind of ghost/haunted kind of place, which would be totally comical. We have old tenants speaking about the rooms, neighborhood, and history of the place. We have Skid Row experts piping up about the area throughout the years, and we have an incredibly weird ex-manager of the Cecil who (IMO) seems to be doing the interview to prove something. 

I just finished the second episode so forgive me if I am wrong in the way I am looking at the docuseries, but it really feels like the whole Elisa Lam part is just an afterthought. They are showing us tidbits of her blogs, while discussing Skid Row, they show us the elevator video, while talking about the spooky tenants and weird architecture, and we get to hear the opinion of internet sleuths (I totally laughed my ass off with that one), and police who seem to be doing everything, yet nothing at the same time (WHO THE HELL DOESNT CHECK THE ROOF??!!)

So I just wanted to say that if you are unsure about whether or not to watch this documentary, try looking at it from a Cecil Hotel docuseries perspective, instead of an Elisa Lam documentary; it makes it a little less disappointing this way.",elisa lam documentary different perspective read different post comment elisa lam documentary incredibly disappointed like decide start series look different perspective opinion documentary cecil hotel happen year include mysterious death elisa lam lot history hotel sense documentary mysterious death try pass kind ghost haunt kind place totally comical old tenant speak room neighborhood history place skid row expert pipe area year incredibly weird ex manager cecil imo interview prove finish second episode forgive wrong way look docuserie feel like elisa lam afterthought tidbit blog discuss skid row elevator video talk spooky tenant weird architecture hear opinion internet sleuth totally laugh ass police time hell doesnt check roof want unsure documentary try look cecil hotel docuserie perspective instead elisa lam documentary little disappointing way,308,-0.011265432098765429,negative,0

No issues gaming or doing anything else. It's literally just Netflix.

If I just leave the app it will continue for about 30 seconds with the same end result. Leaving it, X'ing out of it, ending the process via Task Manager all cause the hard lock.

netflix,"Just finished Narcos Mexico - anyone else think it glorifies drug dealers? [no spoilers] I think it was a good show nothing special. But I really didn't like how it obsessively focussed on their personal lives and soft side.

All the major characters are shown dressed so clean, talk so eloquently and are diplomatic and business-like. But it doesn't AT ALL show the wild side of Mexico's drug scene or the absolute daily brutality in which drug lords execute their strategies.

All the scenes are so slow and dramatic, it just begs you to consider it cool and epic without any substance backing it up. The charcters don't feel dangerous or interesting because we don't see the wild side of them - it's ""too cinematic"" and needs that wild gritty realistic underground edge that is the Mexico drug scene

When I compare it to movies/shows like......

* Traffic (2000)
* Sicario
* The Sopranos
* No Country for Old men
* City of God
* Requiem for a dream

......Narcos just feels really flat, predictable, basic and lacks that wild intensity that other crime/drugs movies have

The show also doesn't match up with what narco journalists (e.g. Ioan Grillo) have been saying about Mexico - that it's a crazy jungle

netflix,"My interpretation of what’s going on in the elevator video from “Crime Scene: The Vanishing at the Cecil Hotel” Now I’ve seen this video before but it’s was a long while ago so this interpretation is from right now after I just saw it again. 

1. Going in I believe she may have already gotten an idea for the area and that’s why she seems so on edge. I don’t think she was being followed. 

2. They talk about her possibly being in something because of her moving her hands and whatever. Now personally I’ve been lost in a daydream conversation before and I’ve caught myself moving my hands and occasionally talking out loud but somewhat mumbly. She also was bipolar so that may have been a factor in the behavior as well. 

3. With her hiding I believe that to be her hearing footsteps, she pressed a lot of buttons and the elevator stopped working. (Which I’ll just say I think the elevator was just shitty and had a moment).

4. With the shoe I believe that was somebody that showed up and was possibly waiting there for someone/something. I don’t believe she knew this person. 

And that’s it. I feel she was having an imaginary conversation, got in the elevator, pressed a ton of buttons which messed up the elevator and she started hearing footsteps and was scared from breaking the elevator so she hid.
